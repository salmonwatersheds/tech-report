Data Quality Score on the Pacific Salmon Explorer,Estimate Type,Survey Method(s),Reliability (within stock comparisons),Units,Accuracy,Precision
High,"1: True Abundance, high resolution","Total, seasonal counts through fence or fishway; virtually no bypass",Reliable resolution of between year differences >10% (in absolute units),Absolute abundance,"Actual, very high",Infinite (i.e. + or - 0%)
Medium-High,"2: True Abundance, medium resolution","High effort (5 or more trips), standard methods (e.g. mark-recapture, serial counts for area under the curve, etc.)",Reliable resolution of between year differences >25% (in absolute units),Absolute abundance,Actual or assigned estimate and high,"Actual estimate, high to moderate"
Medium,"3: Relative Abundance, high resolution","High effort (5 or more trips), standard methods (e.g. equal effort surveys executed by walk, swim, overflight, etc.)",Reliable resolution of between year differences >25% (in absolute units),Relative abundance linked to method,Assigned range and medium to high,"Assigned estimate, medium to high"
Medium-Low,"4: Relative Abundance, medium resolution","Low to moderate effort (1-4 trips), known survey method",Reliable resolution of between year differences >200% (in relative units),Relative abundance linked to method,Unknown assumed fairly constant,Unknown assumed fairly constant
Low,"5: Relative Abundance, low resolution","Low effort (e.g. 1 trip), use of vaguely defined, inconsistent, or poorly executed methods","Uncertain numeric comparisons, but high reliability for presence or absence","Relative abundance, but vague or no i.d. on method",Unknown assumed highly variable,Unknown assumed highly variable
