<h2>Using Indicators to Inform the Status of Salmon and Steelhead Conservation Units and their Habitats<a href="analytical-approach.html#using-indicators-to-inform-the-status-of-salmon-and-steelhead-conservation-units-and-their-habitats" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>We apply a suite of indicators to assess both the biological and habitat status of salmon and steelhead CUs. Defined as “measures of pressures, states, and/or responses”, indicators depict the condition of species, habitats, and/or systems to improve one’s understanding of the linkages among drivers, stressors, conditions, and management actions (ESSA, 2020). The indicators and approach that we use align with Strategies 1 and 2 of the Wild Salmon Policy (DFO, 2005) that call for standardized assessment and monitoring of the salmon CUs and their freshwater habitats Holt et al., 2009; Stalberg et al., 2009).</p>
<p>Relevant salmon and steelhead indicators for informing biological and habitat status have several criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are measurable, relevant to the health and persistence of salmon and steelhead as they characterize either key population dynamics or habitat conditions;</li>
<li>The data are available over broad spatial and temporal scales;</li>
<li>The data are updated consistently;</li>
<li>The data have consistent collection protocols;</li>
<li>The data are in a format that allows easy integration into PSF’s data systems;</li>
<li>The indicators can be tracked over time;</li>
<li>They can be used to inform management decisions for threatened or at-risk salmon and steelhead CUs</li>
</ul>
<p>To quantify the suite of biological and habitat status indicators that we use, we have continued to lead a major effort to compile and synthesize salmon and steelhead-related data in each of the Regions where we work in. While a large amount of salmon and steelhead-related data already exists, they are often not readily available, not well documented, and not compiled in a single location. Our efforts focus on bringing existing information together in a standardized format into a single, centralized location (i.e. the Salmon Data Library) and summarizing the data in valuable ways for monitoring and assessing salmon and steelhead CUs and their habitats (i.e. the Pacific Salmon Explorer).</p>
<p>We then calculate and apply benchmarks for each indicator to assess status using a ‘stoplight’ approach. The result is a qualitative assessment of each indicator as either red, amber, or green, depending on the current data relative to a lower or upper benchmark (Figure <a href="analytical-approach.html#fig:wspFramework">4.1</a>). The intent is that decision-makers can then apply management measures to improve the status of a CU and/or salmon-bearing watershed, for example, from Red to Amber or Amber to Green (DFO, 2005).</p>

<p>The biological status assessments that we complete and visualize on the Pacific Salmon Explorer are guided by the approaches recommended under Strategy 1 of the Wild Salmon Policy (DFO, 2005) and by Holt et al. (2009), as well as additional recommendations from our independent Population Science Advisory Committee. Candidate benchmarks for evaluating the status of CUs have been proposed for four classes of indicators (Holt et al., 2009), which include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Current spawner abundance;</li>
<li>Trends in spawner abundance over time;</li>
<li>Distribution of spawners within the CU; and</li>
<li>Fishing mortality relative to stock productivity.</li>
</ol>
<p>To characterize key salmon and steelhead population dynamics, temporal trends in fisheries data, and assess the biological status of salmon and steelhead CUs across the Pacific Region, we compile and synthesize the following information:</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Overview of Biological indicators<a href="analytical-approach.html#overview-biological-indicators" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>We use eight indicators to characterize the dynamics and status of each Conservation Unit in the <a href="https://www.salmonexplorer.ca">Pacific Salmon Explorer</a>. These indicators provide information on the current state of salmon and steelhead CUs and trends over time. Here, we describe the general approach we take to synthesizing and visualizing these biological indicators. We have documented specific nuances for each region in the <a href="regions.html#regions">Regions</a> section.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1.1</span> Spawner Surveys<a href="analytical-approach.html#spawner-surveys" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p><strong>Spawner surveys</strong> show the observed numbers of spawning salmon of each species returning to specific streams each year. Spawner surveys provide a fundamental piece of information needed to assess the status of salmon CUs over time. We draw on spawner survey data from the <a href="https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/c48669a3-045b-400d-b730-48aafe8c5ee6">New Salmon Escapement Database (NuSEDS)</a> and other sources detailed in <a href="regions.html#regions">Regions</a> to visualize the spatial and temporal coverage of spawner surveys for each CU in the <a href="https://www.salmonexplorer.ca">Pacific Salmon Explorer</a>.</p>
<p>DFO has identified both indicator and non-indicator streams across Regions. <strong>Indicator streams</strong> are observed more consistently in recent decades, tend to have higher spawner abundance, and tend to be monitored using more intensive methods that provide greater accuracy.
<!-- SP: Updated this text; I ran a binomial glm to look at what factors influence indicator/non-indicator in NuSEDS and min year, max year, number of obs, and mean estimate classification type are all signficant, with positive effects of both min and max year (i.e. more recently monitored). -->
Therefore, indicator streams are understood to provide more reliable indices of abundance and are assumed to be representative of returns to other streams nearby (English et al. 2016). <strong>Non-indicator streams</strong> tend to have less consistent survey coverage, more variable survey methods, and/or may be more difficult to survey. A number of both indicator and non-indicator streams within a CU may be surveyed in a given year.</p>
<p>A variety of methods are used to survey spawners in both indicator and non-indicator streams, and methods vary by species, CU, and stream. Spawner counts can be produced from a single visual survey of a stream by foot, by counting fish through a complete counting fence, or by aerial (helicopter) surveys. Survey methodology can also change over time according to changes in capacity and funding; for instance, some streams that were historically monitored by visual surveys on foot are now enumerated via a counting fence or aerial surveys (see <a href="#quality-data">Data Quality</a> section below).</p>
<!-- For steelhead, we used spawner survey data from a variety of sources, depending on the Region. Steelhead monitoring data have not been maintained in a centralized database like NuSEDs, so we compiled and synthesized spawner survey data for steelhead from disparate sources, including from many monitoring projects led by the Province of BC. Streams with spawner survey data for steelhead have not been classified as indicator and non-indicator streams, so we have provisionally classified all streams with available spawner survey data as indicator streams for steelhead. More specific details on the specific sources of spawner survey data for steelhead are summarized by Region in the [Regions](#regions) section. -->

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1.2</span> Spawner Abundance<a href="analytical-approach.html#spawner-abundance" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>We visualize both observed and estimated <strong>spawner abundance</strong> on the <a href="https://www.salmonexplorer.ca">Pacific Salmon Explorer</a>. This indicator provides estimates of the total numbers of spawners that return to spawn each year for each CU. <strong>Observed</strong> spawner abundance is the sum of all spawner survey data as documented in <a href="https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/c48669a3-045b-400d-b730-48aafe8c5ee6">NuSEDS</a>, while <strong>estimated</strong> spawner abundance generally accounts for streams that are not surveyed in a given year by following expansion procedures. The approach for expanding from observed spawners to estimate the total spawners in a CU depends on the region and species, and are documented in the <a href="regions.html#regions">Regions</a> section. Unless specified otherwise, estimated CU-level spawner abundance values are used as inputs in the Trends in Spawner Abundance, Catch and Run Size, and Recruits-per-Spawner indicators described below and when assessing biological status for each CU (see <a href="appendix-4.html#appendix-4">Appendix 4</a>).</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1.3</span> Run Timing<a href="analytical-approach.html#run-timing" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p><strong>Run timing</strong> is estimated using a range of methods, including models based on daily counting fence data to expert judgment reporting mean and standard deviation of the annual return time for each CU. Where these data are available, we visualize the estimated run timing as a normal distribution for each CU.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1.4</span> Catch &amp; Run Size<a href="analytical-approach.html#catch-and-runsize" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p><strong>Catch</strong> estimates report the number of adult salmon or steelhead caught in commercial (including both Canadian and U.S.), recreational, and First Nations’ food, social, and ceremonial (FSC) fisheries. <strong>Run Size</strong> refers to the number of adult salmon or steelhead that return from the ocean in a given year, including both escapement (i.e. estimated spawner abundance) and those that are caught (i.e. catch) at a CU-level. The <strong>exploitation rate</strong> is calculated as the proportion of a given run caught in all fisheries. This indicator provides important information on the long-term harvest rate of each CU, which has implications for the number of salmon and steelhead returning to spawning grounds over time.</p>

<p><strong>Recruits-per-spawner</strong> estimates the number of adult salmon produced per spawner in the previous generation. This indicator provides valuable information on the recruitment of salmon or steelhead within a CU when calculations are available over the long term. This can improve our understanding of survival within and among CUs. If the number of recruits-per-spawner is below one, the population will decline over time. For species with variable age-at-return, estimating the number of recruits for a given brood year requires information on total run size (i.e. catch plus escapement) and the distribution of ages of returning fish over multiple years.
<!-- Insert equation? -->
Recruits-per-spawner is then calculated as the number of recruits divided by the number of spawners for each brood year, based on CU-level estimates of spawning abundance. This indicator is relatively data-intensive and requires information on total run size, spawner abundance, and the ages of salmon or steelhead returning to spawn.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1.6</span> Trends in Spawner Abundance<a href="analytical-approach.html#trends-spawner-abundance" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p><strong>Trends in spawner abundance</strong> is an estimate of spawner abundance at a CU-level over the existing time series. This indicator highlights long-term directional changes in abundance that could otherwise be masked by high interannual variability in population abundance. On the Pacific Salmon Explorer, we show the trends in spawner abundance over the entire time series of available data, as well as the most recent three generations, which aligns with the quantitative for status assessments by the <a href="https://cosewic.ca/index.php/en-ca/assessment-process/wildlife-species-assessment-process-categories-guidelines/quantitative-criteria.html">Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC)</a>. Assuming the data are reliable, considering trends in population abundance over longer time periods may be more likely to detect true changes in abundance and trigger an appropriate management response (d’Eon-Eggerston et al., 2015; Porszt et al., 2012).</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1.8</span> Hatchery Releases<a href="analytical-approach.html#hatchery-releases" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>While salmon hatcheries can play a role in the conservation and management of Pacific salmon, hatchery releases can also pose risks to wild salmon and steelhead. Juvenile hatchery fish can out compete wild juveniles for limited food resources, and there is increasing evidence that high hatchery salmon abundance at sea is related to decreased wild salmon productivity due to limitations of ocean carrying capacity (Ruggerone &amp; Irvine, 2018; Connors et al., 2020). Hatchery-produced spawners can also reproduce with wild salmon and steelhead, with implications for genetic diversity and productivity of wild populations. Hatchery-produced fish can also exacerbate issues in mixed-stock fisheries, which can affect threatened or at-risk salmon and steelhead populations. Given these concerns and other potential impacts of hatcheries on wild salmon and steelhead abundance and productivity, we visualize <strong>hatchery information</strong>, including hatchery locations, type of hatchery, hatchery fish release sites, number of released hatchery fish, and estimates of <strong>hatchery influence</strong> (see <a href="analytical-approach.html#hatchery-release-score">Hatchery Releases Score</a> below). For release sites, we show additional information, including the name of the site, the years that site was in use, the type or life stage at which juvenile salmon or steelhead were released, and the broodstock CU (CU from which the hatchery broodstock originate). Juvenile salmon and steelhead are released at various life stages and after various hatchery practices (e.g. some juveniles are released in rivers as fed fry, while others are reared for longer in the hatchery and then transferred to a sea pen in the ocean, where they are eventually released) which can affect their survival. Data on hatchery locations, release sites, and release numbers were provided by DFO Salmon Enhancement Program staff or for steelhead, were accessed through the Province of BC’s BC Data Catalogue.</p>

<p>These hatcheries release hatchery-produced salmon and steelhead throughout streams in BC, resulting in salmon and steelhead populations that are considered to be hatchery-produced to varying degrees. We assess and display the current Hatchery Releases Score for salmon and steelhead CUs based on a standardized approach that draws on the best available data for all spawning streams within CUs across BC. The <strong>Hatchery Release Score</strong> is an assessment of the extent of hatchery activity within a CU over the last two generations.

<!-- SP: The terminology here needs to be clarified. Stream Hatchery Release(s) Scores vs Hatchery Release Scores?  -->
<p>The determination of a CU’s Hatchery Release Score begins with assessing the extent of hatchery releases among individual spawning streams (indicator and non-indicator) within that CU, based on methods developed by DFO (Brown et al., 2019, 2020). Assessments of stream-level hatchery releases may draw on on three types of information: 1) the number of coded wire tags (CWT) recovered from spawners; 2) the number of juveniles released from hatcheries within the CU; and 3) the number of fish collected for broodstock. If CWT-based estimates are available, then we use the proportion of returning spawners that have CWTs to quantify stream-level hatchery releases. Otherwise, we use the highest number from either the number of juvenile releases or the number of collected broodstock. This information is used to assign a categorical assessment of stream-level hatchery releases (High, Moderate, Low, None, Not Assessed; Table <a href="analytical-approach.html#tab:enhanceAsmt">4.2</a>). For example, if more than 25% of spawners have CWTs, or more than 25% of years have records of juvenile releases or broodstock collection, then the stream is ranked as High (Table <a href="analytical-approach.html#tab:enhanceAsmt">4.2</a>). Data on hatchery activities for each spawning stream for southern BC Chinook was provided by DFO (Brown et al., 2019, 2020). For other species and CUs, we assessed stream-level hatchery releases based on data provided by DFO’s Salmon Enhancement Program. In contrast to Brown et al. (2019), we assessed stream-level hatchery releases over the most recent two generations in alignment with the definition of wild salmon under Canada’s Wild Salmon Policy.</p>
<p>From the stream-level hatchery releases, we calculate the proportional contribution, <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, of streams with Moderate or High stream-level hatchery releases to the total spawners in each CU:
<!-- SP: Completely re-wrote this equation. -->
<span class="math display">\[ c = \frac{\sum_{i \in  H}{\bar{S}_i}}{\sum_{j = 1}^n{\bar{S}_j}}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\bar{S_i}\)</span> is the geometric mean number of spawners in stream <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> over the most recent two generations, <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> are the indices of streams that have Moderate or High stream-level hatchery releases over the most recent two generations, and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the total number of streams in the CU. The CU-level Hatchery Release Score is then assigned as None, Low, Moderate, or High based on the value of <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> (Table <a href="analytical-approach.html#tab:cuenhanceRank">4.3</a>). Note that the distinction between None and Low is related to the timeframe of hatchery releases, with a score of Low indicating that there has been no hatchery releases in the most recent two generations but there are prior recrods of hatchery releases. The CU is assigned a score of Not Assessed if there is insufficient information to assess stream-level hatchery releases.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.3</span> Data Quality<a href="analytical-approach.html#data-quality" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The quality of data shown in the Pacific Salmon Explorer varies widely among Regions, species, CUs, and streams. For instance, spawner abundance obtained from a single aerial survey are less reliable than counts obtained from an unbroken counting fence. We combine spawner survey data with other datasets, such as catch, to determine total run size and to assess the biological status of CUs. As such, measures of <strong>data quality</strong> are important for determining the level of confidence a user should have in the population indicators shown in the Pacific Salmon Explorer.</p>
<p>We developed a standardized approach to assess the quality of data used to estimate spawner abundance and catch for each CU, based on four criteria: 1) spawner survey method, 2) spawner survey coverage, 3) spawner survey execution, and 4) catch estimation method (Table <a href="analytical-approach.html#tab:cudataQual">4.4</a>). We assign scores of 0-5 to each of these four criteria and present the sum of scores over all four criteria as the overall Data Quality Score for each CU. We then translate the final scores into categories of Poor (1-7), Fair (8-14), or Good (15-20) that are displayed on the Pacific Salmon Explorer. A score of zero means that there were no data for that CU. Note that our current data quality assessments do not consider the quality of benchmarks used to assess Biological Status; however, this is an additional aspect of data quality that we would like to explore in the future.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.1.3.1</span> Spawner Survey Method<a href="analytical-approach.html#spawner-survey-method" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>This criterion indicates the quality of spawner survey data over the most recent generation, based on the survey methods and sampling effort across all indicator streams within the CU. The CU-level <strong>Spawner Survey Method</strong> data quality score is calculated as the average of stream-level data quality scores across all indicator streams (as defined by DFO) within the CU. We only quantify data quality for indicator streams because these are the streams that are typically used in expansion and infilling procedures to generate CU-level spawner abundances, while data for non-indicator streams is not directly used.
<!-- SP: Add reference to run reconstruction section?? --></p>
<p>The stream-level data quality scores that we use to calculate a CU-level Spawner Survey Method score are recorded by DFO in the <a href="https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/c48669a3-045b-400d-b730-48aafe8c5ee6">NuSEDS database</a> for each population and year. DFO measures stream-level survey quality on a six-point scale based on a standardized scoring rubric (Table <a href="analytical-approach.html#tab:strmQual">4.5</a>) based on survey methodology and effort. These stream-level data quality scores reflect the highly variable spawner abundance data within and across spawning streams, which arises largely from differences in spawner survey methodology. To improve the communication of the stream-level data quality scores, we translate the “Estimate Classification Type” provided by DFO in NuSEDS into categories labeled as Unknown, Low, Medium-Low, Medium, Medium-High, and High (Table <a href="analytical-approach.html#tab:strmQual">4.5</a>).</p>

<p>To then determine CU-level Spawner Survey Method data quality scores (<span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>), we calculate a weighted average of the stream-level survey method data quality scores across all indicator streams over the most recent generation within the CU (Table <a href="analytical-approach.html#tab:cusurveyQual">4.6</a>). Where there are known issues with DFO’s indicator stream list in NuSEDS, we manually override those data quality scores and substitute expert derived assessments of data quality based on expert knowledge of spawner survey methods. We do not include survey years where spawner survey methods are Unknown. We then translate the CU-level Spawner Survey Methods score into a scale of 0-5 (labeled as Not Applicable, Low, Medium-Low, Medium, Medium-High, And High; (Table <a href="analytical-approach.html#tab:cusurveyQual">4.6</a>)). Note that this score reflects the reliability of the estimates of current spawner abundance for a CU over the most recent generation and not the reliability of estimates across the entire time series.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.1.3.2</span> Spawner Survey Coverage<a href="analytical-approach.html#spawner-survey-coverage" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>This criterion indicates how representative spawner surveys are of the entire Conservation Unit, measured as the proportion of total spawners that spawn in indicator streams. If a CU has a higher proportion of spawners returning to indicator streams. In that case, we assume that the spawner abundance data within that CU is of higher quality since indicator streams are more consistently and reliably surveyed. On the Pacific Salmon Explorer, for the North and Central Coast Regions (Skeena, Nass, and Central Coast), we use the indicator stream list generated and maintained by LGL Ltd (English et al., 2018). We use the indicator stream list provided through the NuSEDS database for all other Regions.</p>
<p>This score is calculated as the average number of spawners in indicator streams divided by the average number of spawners in all indicator and non-indicator streams within the CU, following methods from English et al. (2018). To derive this proportion, we first determine which decade has the greatest coverage of spawner surveys across the indicator and non-indicator streams. We assume that there is a constant proportion of spawners from indicator and non-indicator streams through time. We then calculate the average number of spawners in all indicator and non-indicator streams according to:</p>
<p>where <sub>s</sub> = species, <sub>i</sub> = indicator stream or river, <sub>j</sub> = non-indicator stream or river, ~a = CU, <sub>d</sub> = decade, <sub>y</sub> = year, E<sub>siady</sub> = indicator stream spawners, by stratum and E<sub>sjady</sub> = non-indicator stream spawners, by stratum. This approach is used because it provides a weighted average of the actual number of spawners enumerated with higher quality methodology, rather than only counting the number of indicator and non-indicator streams. We then translate the <strong>Spawner Survey Coverage</strong> score into a scale of 0-5 (labeled as Not Applicable, Low, Medium-Low, Medium, Medium-High, and High; (Table <a href="analytical-approach.html#tab:spawncovScore">4.7</a>)).</p>
<p>For CUs that do not use expansion procedures to generate CU-level estimates (e.g. Fraser sockeye, Chinook, and coho, and Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets Chinook), Spawner Survey Coverage scores were generated via expert opinion.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.4</span> Benchmarks for Assessing Biological Status<a href="analytical-approach.html#benchmarks-biostatus" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>In the Pacific Salmon Explorer, we use the current estimated spawner abundance indicator to assess biological status. In collaboration with our Population Science Advisory Committee, we have developed a set of decision rules to guide our approach to assessing biological status for salmon and steelhead CUs in the Pacific Salmon Explorer (see <a href="analytical-approach.html#bs-decision-rules">Decision Rules</a>). We apply one out of two types of biological benchmarks to quantify the current biological status of CUs, depending on the best available data: (1) spawner-recruit benchmarks and (2) percentile benchmarks (Figure <a href="analytical-approach.html#fig:wspBench">4.2</a>).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:wspBench"></span>
<img src="figures/wsp_benchmarks.png" width="600" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 4.2: Illustration of the Wild Salmon Policy status assessment framework (adapted from Holt et al., 2009). In order to determine the biological status for a given CU, we focus on the geometric mean spawner abundance (metric, blue) under the spawner abundance indicator.
</p>
</div>
<p>The status of each CU is then assessed by comparing the current spawner abundance, calculated as the geometric mean spawner abundance in the most recent generation, to the upper and lower benchmarks. The number of years in a generation is CU-specific based on information about the life-history of each CU. Where CU-specific data on age-at-return are unavailable, we assume generation lengths of 5 years for Chinook CUs, 4 years for coho CUs, 4 years for chum CUs, and 4 years for sockeye CUs. Pink salmon have a consistent 2-year age-at-return and because even- and odd-year lineages are considered separate CUs, the most recent spawner abundance is simply the most recent year’s estimated spawner abundance for this species. A CU is assigned a red status if the current spawner abundance is at or below the lower benchmark, an amber status if the current spawner abundance is above the lower benchmark and at or below the upper benchmark, and a green status if it is above the upper benchmark.</p>
<p>As spawner-recruit benchmarks consider both productivity and carrying capacity of each CU, they are more biologically meaningful, and we aim to apply them whenever possible. However, spawner-recruit benchmarks require spawner abundance and additional data at the CU-level (e.g. age structure and exploitation rates) that may not be available for a given CU. When these data are not available, we calculate benchmarks based on percentiles of historical spawner abundance, referred to as percentile benchmarks. Percentile benchmarks have been shown to approximate spawner-recruit benchmarks (Holt et al., 2018). Except for specific cases (detailed below), they can be a suitable alternative to spawner-recruit benchmarks when the necessary data to estimate spawner-recruit curves are unavailable.</p>

<!-- Note from Steph (June 29, 2023): Need to update to reflect 100% Smsy and 75% S for upper benchmark, and add some text to justify change and provide history. LOTS OF UPDATES NEEDED FOR THIS SECTION-->
<p>We use a Ricker model to describe the spawner-recruit relationship and define associated benchmarks:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[R_{i,t} = S_{i,t} \exp(a_i - b_i S_{i,t}) \]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(R_{i,t}\)</span> is the number of recruits for CU <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and brood year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(S_{i,t}\)</span> is the total number of spawners for CU <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> in year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span> is the CU-level productivity parameter that describes the population growth at low spawner abundance, and <span class="math inline">\(b_i\)</span> is the density-dependence parameter.</p>
<p>A target reference point commonly applied in fisheries is the number of spawners that produces maximum sustainable yield, or <span class="math inline">\(S_{MSY}\)</span>, where yield is <span class="math inline">\(Y = R - S\)</span>. This can be calculated from the above Ricker equation given parameters <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ S_{MSY} = \frac{1-W(e^{1-a})}{b}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is the Lambert W function (Scheuerell 2016). Following recommendations under Canada’s Wild Salmon Policy, use apply an upper spawner-recruit benchmark equal to <span class="math inline">\(S_{MSY}\)</span> (Holt et al., 2009). Subsequent work by DFO has recommended a lower (i.e. less precautionary) benchmark of 80% <span class="math inline">\(S_{MSY}\)</span> to have the Wild Salmon Policy biological status assessments be consistent with other fisheries management plans. Although PSF adopted this change to 80% <span class="math inline">\(S_{MSY}\)</span> for the period 2020-2023, we have since reverted to the original, and more precautionary, upper benchmark of <span class="math inline">\(S_{MSY}\)</span>. The lower spawner-recruit benchmark is <span class="math inline">\(S_{GEN}\)</span>, which is the spawner abundance that leads to <span class="math inline">\(S_{MSY}\)</span> in one generation assuming consistent environmental conditions and no harvest.</p>
<!-- Steph to rewrite -->
<p>To estimate Ricker parameters <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_i\)</span> for each CU <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, we apply a hierarchical bayesian model to spawner-recruit data for all CUs within a species and region combination. The hierarchical model includes hyperparameters for productivity such that data-poor CUs can borrow information from data-rich CUs of the same species within the region to improve parameter estimates. Specifically, each <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span> parameter is drawn from a normal hyperdistribution:
<span class="math display">\[a_i \sim N(\mu_a, \sigma_a) \]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\mu_a\)</span> is the mean productivity among all CUs for the given region and species and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_a\)</span> is the standard deviation in productivity parameters among CUs for the given region and species.</p>
<p>The density-dependence parameter is estimated independently for each CU using CU-specific prior information:
<span class="math display">\[ b_i \sim \text{logNormal} \left( \log \left( \frac{1}{S_{\text{max},i}} \right), \sigma_{b,i} \right) \]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(S_{\text{max},i}\)</span> is the maximum spawner abundance for CU <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{b,i}\)</span> is the standard deviation of <span class="math inline">\(b_i\)</span> for CU <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. Estimates of <span class="math inline">\(S_{\text{max},i}\)</span> from habitat capacity were used as an informative prior where available. To date, habitat capacity data has only been available for lake-type sockeye CUs.
<!-- SP: Question: Do we use habitat capacity estimates for ALL SEL CUs?? Or only some? Also, note that prior on Smax should be max spawners not mean spawners. -->
If habitat capacity data are available and its use is supported by published literature and expert opinion, we use this information to estimate <span class="math inline">\(S_{\text{max},i}\)</span> as an informative prior on <span class="math inline">\(b_i\)</span>. If these data are unavailable, we use <span class="math inline">\(S_{\text{max},i} = 1 / \hat{S}_{\text{max},i}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\hat{S}_{\text{max},i}\)</span> is the maximum observed spawner abundance for CU <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.</p>
<p>We fit estimate parameters <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_i\)</span> for each CU <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> by fitting the linearized Ricker model to spawner and recruit data:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \log \left( \frac{R_{i,t}}{S_{i,t}} \right) = a_i - b_i S_{i,t}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span> is drawn from a region/species hyperdistribution as described above, with priors <span class="math inline">\(\log (\mu_a) \sim N(0.5, 1000)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_a = \sqrt(1/\tau_a)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\tau_a \sim \text{Gamma}(0.5, 0.5)\)</span>. Estimates of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{b,i}\)</span> are unique to each CU and [<strong>to be filled in</strong>]. The above linearized Ricker model is fit to all CUs for a given region and species together in R using the package <code>R2jags</code> (Su and Yajima 2021), with a total number of iterations of 100,000, removing 5000 iterations for burnin and applying a thinning interval of 10. The resulting posterior draws for <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_i\)</span> are used to calculate posteriors for <span class="math inline">\(S_{MSY}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(S_{GEN}\)</span>. The posteriors for these upper and lower benchmarks are summarized by calculating the highest posterior density (HPD) and 95% highest posterior density interval (HPDI). We chose to use these summary statistics instead of the mean or median because the posteriors for <span class="math inline">\(S_{MSY}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(S_{GEN}\)</span> were, in some cases, quite skewed given the tendancy for spawner abundance to be log-normally distributed.
<!-- SP: citation for R2jags: Su Y, Yajima, M (2021). _R2jags: Using R to Run 'JAGS'_. R package version 0.7-1, <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=R2jags>. -->
<!-- SP: Eric, where do the priors on sigma_b come from?? in the SR data files there is a column fo CV but it seems rather arbitrary. -->
For CUs with extremely low productivity, <span class="math inline">\(S_{GEN}\)</span> can be less than <span class="math inline">\(S_{MSY}\)</span>, yielding benchmark values that do not make biological sense (Holt et al., 2018; Peacock et al., 2020). We do not use spawner-recruit benchmarks in these cases and instead apply percentile benchmarks.</p>
<!-- Need to add description of generation length. -->
<p>Biological status of each CU is assessed by comparing the geometric mean spawner abundance over the most recent generation against upper and lower benchmarks. We compare the geometric mean spawner abundance against all posterior draws of <span class="math inline">\(S_{MSY}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(S_{GEN}\)</span> to yield a probability of a CU having each status outcome. The status colour shown on the Pacific Salmon Explorer is the most likely outcome (i.e. the one with the highest posterior probability). The HPD and 95% HPDI for the lower and upper spawner-recruit benchmarks are also shown. See Korman and English (2013) for further details, including a discussion of uncertainty and possible biases in benchmarks and status assessments derived from spawner-recruit models.</p>

<div id="percentile-benchmarks" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="4.1.4.2">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.1.4.2</span> Percentile Benchmarks<a href="analytical-approach.html#percentile-benchmarks" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>To quantify biological status using percentile benchmarks, we define the lower benchmark as the 25th percentile of historical spawner abundance (<span class="math inline">\(S_{25}\)</span>) and the upper benchmark as the 75th percentile of historical spawner abundance (<span class="math inline">\(S_{75}\)</span>), which approximates the upper spawner-recruit benchmark of <span class="math inline">\(S_{MSY}\)</span> (Holt et al., 2018). We then determine the biological status of each CU by comparing the geometric mean of spawner abundance over the most recent generation to these upper and lower benchmarks. For example, a CU is assessed as red status if the current estimate of spawner abundance is at or below the 25th percentile of historical spawner abundance, amber status if the current average spawner abundance is between the 25th and 75th percentiles of historical spawner abundance, and green status if the current average spawner abundance is at or over the 75th percentile.</p>
<p>We also generate and display 95% confidence intervals around the upper and lower percentile benchmark using a model-based computational approach that accounts for autocorrelation in the spawner abundance time series. First, we fit a simple autoregressive (AR) model to the time series of log spawner abundances for each CU to estimate the temporal autocorrelation, using the R function <code>ar</code>. We calculate the temporal autocorrelation. <span class="math inline">\(\phi_1\)</span>, for a lag of one year, but further consideration may want to be given to including other lags. Next, we extract the residuals from the fitted series and sample from those residuals with replacement to generate <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> timeseries of bootstrapped residuals, each with length equal to the length of the original spawner abundance timeseries. Finally, we simulate <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> new time series using the estimated autocorrelation and boostrapped residuals. The equation for simulated spawner abundance timeseries is:

<p>In addition to the standardized assessments of biological status developed by the Pacific salmon and steelhead Foundation, on the Pacific Salmon Explorer, we also display Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) status assessments completed by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), assessments conducted by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC), and/or assessments conducted by the Province of BC where available (Appendix 4). About 10% of salmon CUs in BC have status assessments completed by DFO for the WSP and/or by COSEWIC (COSEWIC, 2017; COSEWIC, 2018; Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 2018). Fisheries and Oceans Canada does not lead status assessments for steelhead under the WSP, but the Province of BC conducts biological status assessments for some steelhead populations under the == Provincial Framework for Steelhead Management in British Columbia (2016) ==. For steelhead CUs, we visualize the outcomes of Province of BC status These assessments apply multiple metrics and expert judgment to assess status and focus primarily on economically significant Chinook, sockeye, and coho CUs in the Fraser and south coast of BC. When available, we display the WSP and COSEWIC status assessments alongside the standardized status assessments completed by PSF. In some cases, statuses may differ between the different assessments due to varying approaches to status evaluation and/or different years of data being used.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.5</span> Decision Rules for Assessing Biological Status<a href="analytical-approach.html#bs-decision-rules" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Deciding which benchmarks are most appropriate for assessing the biological status of a given CU depends on the available data. With input from the Population Science Advisory Committee, we have developed a set of decision rules to guide how we apply benchmarks to assess biological status for all CUs on the Pacific Salmon Explorer (Figure <a href="analytical-approach.html#fig:bsdecisionRules">4.3</a>).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:bsdecisionRules"></span>
<img src="figures/decision_rules_biostatus.png" width="800" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 4.3: Flowchart for documenting decision rules for quantifying biological status.
</p>
</div>
<p>We use the following guiding questions to determine which benchmarks to apply given the available data for a CU.</p>
<p><strong>1. Is there a spawner-recruit relationship available?</strong>
<!-- SP: Should this be revised to read, "Are both spawner and recruit data available at the CU-level? -->
A spawner-recruit relationship must be available to calculate spawner-recruit benchmarks. Most spawner-recruit relationships have over 10 data points (see <a href="appendix-4.html#appendix-4">Appendix 4</a>).</p>
<p><strong>2. Are the CU-level estimates of catch of medium-low quality or higher?</strong></p>
<p>Errors in estimating catch can lead to misclassification of status using spawner-recruit benchmarks (Peacock et al., 2020). As such, we do not apply spawner-recruit when CU-level catch estimates are highly uncertain (i.e. the data quality score for catch estimates is low or medium-low; see <a href="analytical-approach.html#data-quality">Data Quality</a>).</p>
<p><strong>3. Is there published evidence of cyclic dominance for the CU?</strong></p>
<p>Some CUs have population dynamics characterized by cyclic dominance (e.g. a four-year generation length that involves a dominant brood year that is most abundant, a sub-dominant brood year, followed by two brood lines with lower abundance). For these cyclic dominant CUs we do not pool data across brood lines to generate estimates of current spawner abundance or to generate CU-level benchmarks because spawner abundance is so different from year to year (Grant et al., 2020). For these CUs, we currently only visualize biological status assessments on the Pacific Salmon Explorer developed through integrated status assessments that incorporate expert judgment and quantitative modeling, where available (e.g. DFO, 2018).</p>
<p><strong>4. Does the CU-level spawner abundance time series span at least 20 years?</strong></p>
<p>Estimates of spawner abundance over a relatively long time series are required to assess the biological status of a CU. We require a minimum of 20 years of annual estimates of spawner abundance, although we do not require that these estimates are continuous. In some cases, we may use only a subset of the available time series. We do this if expert opinion suggests that using the entire time series is not appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>5. Is there a spawner abundance estimate at the CU-level for at least one year over the most recent generation?</strong></p>
<p>We require at least one annual estimate of spawner abundance over the most recent generation to quantify current spawner abundance. We then take the geometric mean of current spawner abundance over the most recent generation to compare to the estimated benchmarks for that CU to assess biological status.</p>
<p><strong>6. Is the productivity of the CU expected to be below 2.5 and exploitation above 40%?</strong></p>
<p>We do not apply percentile benchmarks if productivity is low (&lt; 2.5) and fisheries exploitation is high (&gt; 40%). In these cases, percentile benchmarks can result in biological status assessments that are overly optimistic and, therefore, risky from a long-term management perspective (Holt et al., 2018; Peacock et al., 2020).</p>
<p>For a number of CUs across all Regions, data limitations mean that we cannot assess the current biological status. In these cases, we categorize these CUs as data deficient. We consider three types of data deficiencies when assessing biological status for the Pacific Salmon Explorer. First, some CUs have no available run reconstruction and, therefore, no CU-level spawner abundance estimate. This could be because there is no data for that CU in NuSEDS, meaning there has been no record of spawner surveys conducted for the CU since 1954. This could also be because the CU does not have an identified indicator stream, which means that CU-level estimates of spawner abundance cannot be estimated,
<!-- SP: I think we can reconsider this given the unreliability of DFO's indicator classification. Could be a project for Bruno...maybe we can come up with some defensible criteria and classify indicators ourselves? -->
and biological status cannot be assessed. Second, some CUs may have no data on spawner abundance for the most recent generation. This means that we cannot generate an estimate of current abundance to compare against the benchmarks to assess biological status. Finally, in some cases, we may have sufficient data (i.e. run reconstructions) to assess biological status using our methods, but expert advice from our technical committees and Population Science Advisory Committee suggests that we should not assess status using our standardized approach. This can be due to the complexity of a species or CU life history (e.g. Fraser River cyclic sockeye CUs; see Fraser Region; Grant et al., 2020), other data challenges, or assumptions that are currently a barrier to applying our standardized approach.</p>
<p>Given the iterative and incremental development approach that we take to visualizing salmon and steelhead data and assessing biological status, the current set of decision rules outlined in this technical report are subject to change to ensure that our methods align with current best practices for quantifying biological status. As such, the methods and decision rules presented here diverge from previously published PSF technical reports documenting our approach to assessing biological status in specific Regions (Connors et al., 2013; Connors et al., 2018; Connors et al., 2019).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.6</span> Extinct, De Novo, and Transplant CUs<a href="analytical-approach.html#extinct" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Over time, DFO may re-classify CUs in several ways: 1) if CU-level spawner abundance declines to a point where the CU is lost (“extinct”), 2) if a CU is extinct and then re-introduced with different genetic stock (“de novo”), or 3) if a CU is created by introducing populations to a where they were not previously present (“transplant”). We visualize these categories on the Pacific Salmon Explorer, intending to maintain a historical record of Pacific salmon and steelhead’s changing genetic diversity and abundance (see <a href="appendix-1.html#appendix-1">Appendix 1</a> and <a href="appendix-4.html#appendix-4">Appendix 4</a>).</p>

<p>There are a number of limitations to the biological status assessments that we visualize on the Pacific Salmon Explorer. Some limitations, such as CU-level estimates of spawner abundance, developing benchmarks, and monitoring coverage, apply to all species and Regions. These caveats should be considered when interpreting the biological status assessments’ results and applying them to future research priorities.</p>

<p>If a complete census or true count of spawners is not available for all streams within a CU, DFO applies expansion factors to generate CU-level estimates of spawner abundance. The number of indicator streams that are counted in a given year for each CU (spawner survey coverage) has been declining since the late 1990s in many Regions included in the Pacific Salmon Explorer (e.g. English et al., 2018), resulting in an increasing magnitude of this extrapolation from spawner counts at monitored streams to CU-level estimates of spawner abundance. As fewer indicator streams are used to represent what we know about spawner abundance for a potentially large and complex CU, it has become increasingly difficult to know how many spawners are returning. This could be particularly problematic if the contribution of streams within a CU as related to overall abundance changes through time. The expansion factor approach applied by DFO is generally recognized as the best practice for generating CU-level estimates of spawner abundance in many cases (e.g. on the North and Central Coast; English et al. 2012). Our work aims to derive biological status assessments of individual CUs relative to different metrics and not, for example, to set management targets or catch allocation, so the assumptions that support these expansion procedures should not overly influence this work.</p>
<p>In addition, recent simulation analyses to determine the influence of these expansion factors on biological status assessments using our approach found that they were robust to a range of expansion procedures (Peacock et al., 2020). Peacock et al. (2020) suggest that, under certain conditions, declining monitoring coverage (to a point) has little impact on the accuracy of benchmarks or biological status assessments using our methods. We have also attempted to account for differing levels of monitoring coverage as part of our work to quantify data quality for visualization on the Pacific Salmon Explorer (see <a href="analytical-approach.html#data-quality">Data Quality</a>).</p>

For example, if available, habitat-based benchmarks (e.g. Parken et al., 2006) could be applied to situations where other biological benchmarks cannot be used.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Habitat Status: Indicators &amp; Benchmarks<a href="analytical-approach.html#indicators-benchmark-hab" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Our assessments of habitat status that we complete and visualize on the Pacific Salmon Explorer follow the approaches developed for evaluating status under Strategy 2 of the Wild Salmon Policy (DFO, 2005). Following this guidance, monitoring should be informed by information on a suite of habitat indicators. <strong>Habitat indicators</strong> provide a measure of the characteristics of the environment, such as the habitat condition, magnitude of stress, degree of exposure to a stressor, or ecological response to exposure. To evaluate the potential risk of degradation to freshwater salmon and steelhead habitat, each indicator should be relevant to salmon and steelhead and represent a clear scientific understanding of either a direct or an indirect relationship between itself and its impact on salmon and steelhead.</p>
<p>Habitat indicators can be further described as either pressure indicators or state indicators following the two-tiered pressure and state indicator framework described by Stalberg et al. (2009). <strong>Pressure indicators</strong> are natural processes or human activities that can directly or indirectly induce qualitative or quantitative changes in environmental conditions (Stalberg et al., 2009). <strong>State indicators</strong> are physical, chemical, or biological attributes measured to characterize environmental conditions on the ground (Stalberg et al., 2009). Distinguishing features between pressure and state indicators include the scale of assessment, the resolution of input data, and the cost of assessment and monitoring. Pressure indicators are often assessed for large geographic areas using remotely sensed information. Pressure indicators evaluation and quantification of pressure indicators are less resource intensive because data collection and monitoring are typically not based on on-the-ground field studies.
On the other hand, state indicators are assessed for smaller geographic areas, often require higher resolution data to evaluate and quantify, and require more resources as they often require on-the-ground fieldwork. Our work to date focuses on pressure indicators as the first step to gaining a regional-scale understanding of habitat conditions over broad geographic extents. Our intent and ambition are for these assessments of habitat pressure indicators to lead to the identification of priority areas to conduct finer-scale state indicator assessments and monitoring.</p>
<p>Through an expert-guided process as part of our work in the Skeena Region (Porter et al., 2013a; Porter et al., 2014), we identified 12 habitat pressure indicators: forest disturbance, equivalent clearcut area, insect and disease defoliation, riparian disturbance, road development, water licenses, stream crossing density, total land cover alteration, impervious surfaces, linear development, mining development, and waste water discharges. We assess these 12 habitat indicators individually and cumulatively for every salmon and steelhead-bearing watershed in BC.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Scale of Habitat Assessments<a href="analytical-approach.html#scale-of-habitat-assessments" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The base reporting unit for our assessments of habitat pressure indicators is the 1:20,000 Freshwater Atlas (FWA) assessment watersheds dataset (MOE, 2017a). The Freshwater Atlas is the most comprehensive, standardized source of hydrologic features in BC. The FWA assessment watersheds dataset is a commonly used provincial baseline dataset for resource managers, researchers, and others interested in evaluating and reporting at a watershed scale. The FWA assessment watersheds replace the legacy 1:50,000 BC Watershed Atlas Third-Order Watersheds dataset. Assessment watersheds are delineated at a scale where hillslope and channel processes are generally well linked, between 2,000 to 10,000 hectares (Carver &amp; Gray 2009).</p>

<p>Our assessment methodology uses the concept of a <strong>zone of influence (ZOI)</strong> to identify the area of land considered to influence freshwater salmon and steelhead habitat. Using ZOIs to assess salmon and steelhead freshwater habitats aligns with Strategy 2 of the Wild Salmon Policy, in that 1) the identification of habitats that support or limit salmon and steelhead production is necessary to inform assessment, monitoring, and protection priorities; and 2) that habitat requirements vary by species, life history characteristics and phase, and geography (DFO, 2005).</p>
<ul>
<li>We define ZOIs for the spawning life stage for each salmon and steelhead CU. A <strong>spawning ZOI</strong> represents the area of land that drains into the spawning habitat of a specific salmon and steelhead CU.</li>
</ul>
<p>We use the geographic extents of ZOIs to assess and quantify habitat pressures by CUs for the spawning life stage. The specific rules for defining ZOIs were developed in collaboration with PSF’s Skeena Technical Advisory Committee (Porter et al., 2013a; Porter et al., 2014) and are defined in <a href="appendix-5.html#appendix-5">Appendix 5</a> with species and Region-specific nuances, where relevant.</p>

<p>We need to know where salmon and steelhead spawn to identify ZOIs and assess pressures on salmon and steelhead spawning habitats. We use spawning location data to identify and delineate salmon and steelhead spawning habitats, identify upland areas that may impact spawning habitats, and use this information to determine the relevant spatial extent for habitat assessments. We identify salmon and steelhead spawning locations using several key data sources: The Fisheries Information Summary System (FISS) database, technical reports, maps, additional databases when available, and local knowledge derived through expert elicitation.</p>
<div id="fisheries-information-summary-system" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="4.2.3.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.3.1</span> Fisheries Information Summary System<a href="analytical-approach.html#fisheries-information-summary-system" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>The FISS database is a legacy project which was a jointly funded initiative between BC Fisheries and DFO, intending to provide fish habitat data for water bodies throughout BC and the Yukon (MOE, 2017b). FISS data is distributed under two datasets via DataBC on the BC Data Catalogue. The two datasets, specifically, are “BC Historical Fish Distribution Zones (50,000)” and “Known BC Fish Observations and BC Fish Distributions.” The latter dataset, the Known BC Fish Observations, and BC Fish Distributions, carries the description on DataBC as “the most current and comprehensive information source on fish presence for the province.”</p>
<p>As of 2001, the Province of BC no longer maintains the spawning zones or linear distribution dataset (“BC Historical Fish Distribution - Zones (50,000)”), but the Known BC Fish Observations and BC Fish Distributions dataset is an actively maintained dataset. This dataset houses the legacy FISS data as well as data from other provincially maintained sources. However, efforts to maintain fish location data are not standardized province-wide, and thus both data coverage and accuracy vary across BC. The province continues to document ongoing data submissions from organizations or individuals required to report fisheries data and sampling information as part of the reporting requirements for a Scientific Fish Collection Permit (a permit to capture or collect fish specimens for scientific or other non-recreational or commercial purposes). The province also documents submissions of non-permitted fish and fish habitat information on a voluntary basis. While there are some challenges with these datasets, we use these datasets as a base representation of spawning locations as these two datasets are the most comprehensive source of spawning data available province-wide. We filtered these datasets to Pacific salmon and steelhead species and spawning activity types to identify spawning locations.</p>

<p>Given the limitations of the provincially available datasets, we work with local expert knowledge holders in each Region to review and supplement the existing spawning location information using hard copy paper maps and our ESRI-based mapping platform, the salmon and steelhead Habitat Mapper (Figure <a href="analytical-approach.html#fig:habMapper">4.4</a>). We use a structured process whereby we 1) compile large-format paper maps of each study area which include spawning location data, and 2) use the salmon and steelhead Habitat Mapper, a private online tool that we developed for exploring and contributing spawning data. Using these two tools, we work with project partners with local knowledge of where salmon and steelhead spawn in each Region to review the existing spawning location data and augment those data with additional sites of known spawning locations. These review sessions typically include both fisheries staff and community members who work with us over a day-long workshop in their local area within a Region. Any additional data documented via the large-format paper maps are then digitized and integrated, along with data collected via the salmon and steelhead Habitat Mapper, into our spawning locations dataset.</p>

<p>For all spawning location information, we assign spawning locations to individual CUs. For all species except lake-type sockeye, we assign spawning locations to CUs by determining which CU a spawning location was located within. This is done on a species-specific basis, except for pink CUs. If spawning location data sources did not differentiate between even-year or odd-year pink, we attributed that spawning location to both even-year and odd-year pink CUs in that area (where applicable). For lake-type sockeye, CU boundaries tend to be constrained to a rearing lake, so to capture the side channels where salmon and steelhead spawn, we used the rearing lake zone of influence to locate spawning areas. Where sockeye spawning locations were situated outside the lake-type sockeye spawning zone of influence, those spawning locations were assigned to the river-type sockeye CU whose boundary they were located within.</p>

<p>We developed this set of habitat pressure indicators during our initial methodology development with the Skeena Technical Advisory Committee (Porter et al., 2013a; Porter et al., 2014), building off the recommendations for monitoring and evaluation of salmon and steelhead habitats under the Wild Salmon Policy (Stalberg et al., 2009), and incorporating additional pressure indicators proposed by Nelitz et al. (2007). Some of these same indicators have been used in other habitat assessment work in the Fraser River watershed (Nelitz et al., 2011) and on the west coast of Vancouver Island (e.g. Smith &amp; Wright, 2016; Wright et al., 2011).</p>
<p>We use specific inclusion criteria to select the datasets we use to inform these habitat pressure indicators to ensure that our methodologies are standardized across Regions. The data that we include must be:
- Publicly available and readily accessible;
- Created with consistent and documented data collection protocols;
- Formatted to allow easy integration into our existing data systems;
- Cost-effective for long-term data collection;
- Reflective of both short- and long-term responses and trends in a given indicator;
- Appropriate to the geographic scale of analysis;
- Supported by quality assurance/quality control protocols and an established data update process.</p>
<p>All of the data we use to inform the 12 habitat pressure indicators are sourced from publicly available provincial or federal agency databases. Most indicator data are sourced from DataBC. Additional datasets are sourced from the BC Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy, BC Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development (FLNRORD), BC Ministry of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation, as well as Natural Resources Canada. The publication year for indicator datasets is between 1992 and 2021 (see <a href="appendix-6.html#appendix-6">Appendix 6</a> for detailed descriptions and limitations, <a href="appendix-7.html#appendix-7">Appendix 7</a> for a complete listing of datasets, publication years, and data sources).</p>
<p>We quantify each indicator at the scale of the 1:20,000 FWA assessment watersheds based on the specific units of each indicator using ArcGIS Desktop 10.8.1 and a python-scripted ArcGIS Model Builder toolbox. Data processing generally follows a process of selecting features of interest from each indicator dataset and intersecting those with FWA watersheds to quantify habitat pressures by watershed (see <a href="appendix-8.html#appendix-8">Appendix 8</a> for a complete description of processing methods for each indicator).</p>

<p>Similar to the biological status assessments, we quantify benchmarks for each indicator to assess habitat status. Using benchmarks allows us to categorize the risk of habitat degradation as low, moderate, or high (green, amber, or red status zones, respectively). When available, we use empirical benchmarks for habitat pressure indicators based on published literature (e.g. Stalberg et al., 2009). When empirical benchmarks are not available, we develop benchmarks based on relative distribution curves for each indicator across the full spatial extent of individual Regions on the Pacific Salmon Explorer (i.e. Fraser Region, Skeena Region, etc.; (Table <a href="analytical-approach.html#tab:habIndbench">4.12</a>)). While this approach is consistent with the recommendations of Stalberg et al. (2009), it is considered an interim approach until empirical or expert-based benchmarks become available.</p>

<p>We use two approaches for developing relative benchmarks, depending on the distribution of the indicator data. These approaches were developed during our initial work on habitat pressure indicators with the Skeena Technical Advisory Committee (Porter et al., 2013a; Porter et al., 2014) and were later refined to address indicators with highly skewed distributions (Porter et al., 2016).</p>
<p><em>Type 1: Indicator values have symmetric or moderately skewed distributions</em></p>
<p>We take this approach if habitat indicators have a symmetric or moderately skewed distribution. Using the distribution of indicator values across all Freshwater Atlas (FWA) assessment watersheds, we set the lower benchmark at the 50th percentile and the upper benchmark at the 75th percentile. This means that the “best” 50% of watersheds are considered low risk (green), the “worst” 25% of watersheds are considered high risk (red), and all other watersheds are considered at moderate risk (amber) for that pressure indicator.</p>
<p><em>Type 2: Indicator values have a highly skewed distribution</em></p>
<p>If habitat indicators have a highly skewed distribution, we set the lower benchmark at 0 and the upper benchmark at the statistical threshold for outlier values. Using this approach, watersheds with a 0 value are considered low risk (green), watersheds with outlier values are considered high risk (red), and all other watersheds are considered moderate risk (amber) for that pressure indicator.</p>
<p>In some cases, the indicator values may be so highly skewed that the outlier threshold is zero. In these cases, we apply a binary approach where watersheds with a 0 value are considered low risk (green, absence), and watersheds with a value above zero are considered high risk (red, presence). This binary approach applies to the Mining Development, Water Licenses, and Waste Water Discharges indicators (Table <a href="analytical-approach.html#tab:habIndbench">4.12</a>). See <a href="analytical-approach.html#hab-method-limits">Limitations</a> section for further discussion of relative benchmark rankings.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.6</span> Approach to Assessing Cumulative Habitat Pressures<a href="analytical-approach.html#assess-cumulative-pressure" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Pressures on salmon and steelhead freshwater habitats have both an individual and potential cumulative impact. We develop cumulative pressure scores for each FWA assessment watershed across CUs and Regions in the Pacific Salmon Explorer to reflect these interactions and understand the risk of habitat degradation posed by cumulative pressures. This approach allows us to visualize which CUs face the greatest potential cumulative risks to habitat conditions based on the set of pressure indicators that we assess. Cumulative scores are useful for providing a baseline to consider future risks and identify priority areas to avoid further impacts. A cumulative pressure score also provides a summary index to consider pressures on salmon and steelhead habitat in relation to the biological status of CUs. This information can help in prioritizing conservation efforts, mitigation strategies, and identifying areas for monitoring state indicators at a higher resolution.</p>
<p>Aggregating indicators into a single, composite risk or condition score is an approach taken by a variety of programs that currently monitor watersheds in Canada and the U.S. Pacific Northwest (e.g. FLNRORD’s Forest and Range Evaluation Program, USEPA’s Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program, USDA Forest Service’s Aquatic and Riparian Effectiveness Monitoring Program). These programs use a variety of methods to aggregate their habitat data, and each approach has strengths and weaknesses (Pickard et al., 2008). Habitat indicator analyses for BC salmon and steelhead CUs (e.g. Cohen Commission analyses of Fraser sockeye CUs (Nelitz et al., 2011) and an indicator-mapping project for the Lower Thompson coho CU (Beauchamp, 2008) generated cumulative habitat stressor or impact scores based on a simple summation of all the individually scored indicators (i.e. a higher total score equates to higher risk). Habitat assessments for southern BC Chinook CUs (Porter et al., 2013b) employed an alternative approach for rating relative risk in watersheds whereby cumulative risk scoring was based on an indicator ‘roll-up’ rule set based on the proportion of the indicators that were rated low, moderate, or high risk.</p>
<p>For the habitat pressure assessments included in the Pacific Salmon Explorer, we apply a set of roll-up rules to assign cumulative pressure scores (see <a href="appendix-11.html#appendix-11">Appendix 11</a>). We calculate this cumulative pressure score for individual 1:20,000 FWA assessment watersheds within the zones of influence of all CUs. Any Region-specific idiosyncrasies are documented within the <a href="regions.html#regions">Regions</a> section.</p>

<div id="future-resource-development-pressures" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.2.7">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.7</span> Future Resource Development Pressures<a href="analytical-approach.html#future-resource-development-pressures" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>In addition to assessing risks to freshwater salmon and steelhead habitats based on 12 pressure indicators, we also compile data and map information on proposed resource development projects that represent potential additional risks to salmon and steelhead and their freshwater habitats. These ‘future pressures’ are not quantitatively integrated into the habitat pressure assessments; however, we do map data on proposed resource development projects alongside current development projects in recognition of the potential impacts these activities may have on freshwater salmon and steelhead habitats and to allow for the consideration of habitat status in the siting and planning of proposed development projects.</p>
<p>Specifically, activities related to the construction and operation of industrial infrastructure can affect the physical and chemical nature of streams, rivers, and upland habitat and potentially lead to degradation, fragmentation, and loss of spawning, rearing, and migration habitats (Natural Research Council, 1996). salmon and steelhead are sensitive to changes in stream temperature, flow, turbidity, dissolved oxygen levels, and water contamination. As well, salmon and steelhead are dependent on the habitat complexity (for cover and temperature moderation) provided by naturally vegetated banks and, therefore may be affected by degradation or alteration of shorelines and stream banks.</p>
<p>For each Region, we compile data on seven categories of proposed (and current) resource development pressures:
- Oil and gas pipelines
- Mining development
- Water licenses
- Hydroelectric power tenures
- Hydroelectric power lines
- Wind power tenures
- Timber harvesting land base</p>
<p>For additional processing details, see <a href="appendix-9.html#appendix-9">Appendix 9</a>. In some Regions, we are also able to document additional infrastructure; this is detailed in <a href="regions.html#regions">Regions</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.8</span> Limitations: Habitat pressure indicators &amp; analysis methods<a href="analytical-approach.html#hab-method-limits" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>While the current suite of indicators has been developed according to Wild Salmon Policy guidelines (Stalberg et al., 2009), they do not reflect all of the pressures on wild salmon and steelhead. Understanding the full range of pressures on salmon and steelhead requires documenting marine habitat pressures, climate change indicators, and a deeper understanding of fisheries pressure, to name a few. Given the set of habitat pressure indicators that we currently include on the Pacific Salmon Explorer, specific limitations of our approach relate to outdated and incomplete datasets, benchmark methodologies, and methods for calculating cumulative pressure scores. These limitations apply to all Regions, species, and CUs that we include in the Pacific Salmon Explorer and should be considered as both caveats to the current habitat assessment results as well as future research priorities.</p>
<div id="data-needs" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="4.2.8.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.8.1</span> Data Needs<a href="analytical-approach.html#data-needs" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Incomplete and outdated datasets are a continued challenge for completing coarse-scale assessments of risks to freshwater habitats. For example, the Total Land Cover Alteration indicator uses land cover classification data between 1996-2005 and the National Topographic system dataset from 1998. This is an example of where more current datasets certainly exist but are either not yet publicly available or may not conform to our data selection criteria.</p>
<p>Throughout the Regions in BC, some areas contain privately managed forest land. As such, forest disturbance data sourced from DataBC in these areas is either incomplete or not up to date. We defined a ‘Data Deficient’ status for the forest disturbance indicator to overcome this challenge. The data deficient status was assigned for any watershed that was &gt;= 50% privately owned forest. The exception was that high-risk status was maintained and reported if a watershed was high risk for forest disturbance based on the publicly available forest disturbance data.</p>
<p>Overall, temporal and spatial data gaps limit our ability to quantify and assess current freshwater salmon and steelhead habitat risks accurately. Better and more currently maintained spatial data are needed to support a more accurate and up-to-date assessment of pressures on freshwater salmon and steelhead habitats across all Regions (see <a href="appendix-6.html#appendix-6">Appendix 6</a> for dataset limitations).</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.8.2</span> Refining Benchmarks<a href="analytical-approach.html#refine-hab-benchmarks" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Additional research is needed to define science-based benchmarks for some pressure indicators. In the interim, we use benchmarks based on relative rankings within each Region ((Table <a href="analytical-approach.html#tab:habIndbench">4.12</a>); see <a href="appendix-12.html#appendix-12">Appendix 12</a> for specific benchmark values for each Region). While acceptable as an interim approach (Stalberg et al., 2009), this presents data interpretation challenges and limits our ability to compare habitat assessments across Regions for those indicators. Until empirical or science-based benchmarks are available, it is important to consider the relative nature of the habitat assessments for these indicators when interpreting the results.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.8.3</span> Cumulative Pressure Scores<a href="analytical-approach.html#cp-scores" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>The approach we use to calculate overall cumulative pressure scores for freshwater salmon and steelhead habitats is a roll-up rule set described in <a href="appendix-11.html#appendix-11">Appendix 11</a>. Using this approach means that each indicator is weighted equally in terms of the overall cumulative pressure score. We do not weight certain indicators as having more or less impact on salmon and steelhead habitat over others. Determining how best to aggregate indicators to calculate overall cumulative pressure scores is a challenge, and while this approach is transparent and easily understood by a range of audiences, it is certainly not the only way to aggregate indicators, nor necessarily the best way.</p>

<p>In addition to providing biological and habitat information for individual salmon and steelhead CUs, we also provide information on the status and trends of salmon and steelhead populations and their habitats at the <strong>Stock Management Unit (SMU)</strong>, regional, and <strong>provincial scales</strong> to improve understanding of the current state of salmon and steelhead at different geographic scales. While finer-scale data such as CUs are important for supporting the implementation of Canada’s Wild Salmon Policy, coarser-scale synoptic overviews of salmon and steelhead population status and trends across species and regions are also important for salmon and steelhead conservation and management. These multi-scale overviews help to improve understanding of patterns in trends and status of salmon and steelhead CUs across or within regions of BC and offer insights into potential habitat pressures that could be driving changes in salmon and steelhead populations. They can also inform regional, provincial, and federal planning and decision-making.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.2</span> Regional Summaries<a href="analytical-approach.html#regional-sum" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Biological information is summarized at the <strong>regional scale</strong> to provide a measure of how the total number of returning adult salmon and steelhead has changed over time for each species within each Region on the Pacific Salmon Explorer. We determine (1) the total run size (catch + spawner abundance) for each individual CU and; (2) the total salmon and steelhead run size for all CUs combined within a given species. In the Pacific Salmon Explorer, we display the total run size for each CU within each species in a single Region, along with the same total run size data standardized so that larger CUs do not dominate the summaries. In both cases, we also display the overall trend for each species.</p>
<p>Habitat information is also summarized at the <strong>regional scale</strong> for each Region in the Pacific Salmon Explorer by providing a comparison of the 12 habitat pressure indicators. In the Pacific Salmon Explorer, for each indicator, we display the percentage of FWA watersheds within the combined ZOI for all CUs within a species that are rated low, moderate, and high risk. The indicators are then ranked from high to low relative to the percentage of high-risk FWA watersheds assessed for a given indicator. This summary provides a snapshot of how the pressure indicators rank compared to one another and which pressures included in the Pacific Salmon Explorer pose the greatest risk to freshwater salmon and steelhead habitats within a Region.</p>
<div id="provincial-sum" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="4.3.2.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.3.2.1</span> Provincial Summaries<a href="analytical-approach.html#provincial-sum" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>On the Pacific Salmon Explorer, we provide an overview of the status and trends of salmon and steelhead CUs at the <strong>BC scale</strong> based on two indicators, run size and biological status. Trends in run size provide a measure of how the total number of returning adult salmon and steelhead has changed over time for each species. We display (1) the total run size (catch + spawner abundance) over time by species in each Region, (2) the standardized run size (catch + spawner abundance) over time by species in each Region, and (3) the percent change between the most recent decade relative to the long-term average. We also summarize the current biological status for each salmon and steelhead species across BC and a visual comparison of biological status across regions via maps. This summary provides a snapshot of the current biological status by species by quantifying the proportion of CUs within a species in the green, amber, and red status zones. It also shows <em>where</em> these CUs are located.</p>
<p>We do not currently visualize habitat summary statistics at the BC scale. Differences in the way habitat benchmarks are quantified (e.g. relative vs. science-based benchmarks; see <a href="#habitat-pressure-indicator-benchmarks">Habitat Pressure Indicator Benchmarks</a> present challenges in making provincial comparisons of habitat status. Through future work with the Habitat Science Advisory Committee, we hope to develop BC-scale habitat summaries.</p>
