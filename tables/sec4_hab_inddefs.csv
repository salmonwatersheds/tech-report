Impact Category,Indicator,Metric,Definition,Relevance
Human Development Footprint,Total Land Cover Alteration,% watershed area,The percentage of the total watershed area that has been altered by human activity.,"Total land cover alteration is a synthesis of the indicators for forest disturbance, urban land use, agriculture/rural land use, mining development, and other smaller developments. This indicator represents a suite of potential changes to hydrological processes and sedimentation, with potential impacts on salmon habitats."
,Mining Development,# of mines,"The number of active and past-producing coal, mineral, or aggregate (gravel) mine sites within a watershed.","The footprint of a mine and mining processes can change geomorphology and the hydrological processes of water bodies nearby. Mining can contribute to the deposition of fine sediments, which can affect salmon prey densities and salmon survival."
,Impervious Surfaces,% watershed area,"The percentage of the total watershed area that is represented by hard, impervious surfaces (e.g. paved)",Extensive impervious surfaces in a watershed can alter and affect natural hydrologic flow patterns and lead to stream degradation through changes in geomorphology and hydrology. They can also lead to increased nutrient loading and contaminant loads downstream.
,Linear Development,km/km2,"The density of all linear developments within a watershed, including roads, railways, utility corridors, pipelines, power lines, telecom cables, right of ways, etc.",Linear development gives an indication of the overall level of development from resource activities that may affect salmon habitats.
Hydrologic Processes,Forest Disturbance,% watershed area,The percentage of total watershed area that has been disturbed by logging and burning in the last 60 years.,"Logging and other disturbances that reduce forest cover can change watershed hydrology by affecting rainfall interception, transpiration, and snowmelt processes. Changes over time can affect salmon habitats through altered peak flows, low flows, and annual water yields."
,Equivalent Clearcut Area (ECA),% watershed area,"The percentage of total watershed area that is considered functionally and hydrologically comparable to a clearcut forest. Landscapes that have been altered by urban, road, rail, and forestry development, as well as crown tenure, were considered.",ECA reflects the pressure on salmon habitat mainly from potential increases in peak flow.
Vegetation Quality,Riparian Disturbance,% watershed area,"The percentage of the riparian zone, defined as a 30m buffer around all streams, lakes, and wetlands, that have been altered by human activity in each watershed.","Disturbance to riparian areas can affect salmon habitats by destabilizing stream banks, increasing surface erosion and sedimentation, reducing nutrient and woody debris inputs to water bodies, and increasing stream temperatures if streamside shading is diminished."
,Insect and Disease Defoliation,% watershed area,The percentage of pine forests that have been killed by insects or disease in each watershed.,"Forest defoliation from insects or disease can reduce precipitation interception, reduce transpiration, and lead to increased soil moisture. The resulting changes to peak flows and groundwater supplies can affect salmon habitats."
Surface Erosion,Road Development,km/km2,The average density of all roads within a watershed,"Road development can interrupt subsurface flow, increase peak flows, and interfere with natural patterns of overland water flow in a watershed. Roads are a significant cause of increased erosion and fine sediment generation, which can impact downstream spawning and rearing habitats."
Fish Passage / Habitat Connectivity,Stream Crossing Density,#/km,The total number of stream crossings per km of the total length of modeled salmon habitat in a watershed.,"Stream crossings can create problems for fish passage by interfering with or blocking access to upstream spawning or rearing habitats, thus decreasing the total amount of available salmon habitat. Stream crossings can also affect water delivery to the stream network, causing increased peak flows and become a source of fine sediment delivery to streams."
Water Quantity,Water Licenses,# of permitted water licenses,"The total number of water licenses permitted for water withdrawal for domestic, industrial, agricultural, power, and storage uses from points of diversion within a watershed. ","Heavy allocation and use of both surface and subsurface water for human use can affect salmon habitat by reducing instream flows to levels that could, at critical times of the year, limit physical access to spawning and rearing habitats or potentially expose redds. Reductions in both surface and subsurface water supply can also lead to increased water temperatures, which can impact salmon at all life stages."
Water Quality,Waste Water Discharges,# of permitted waste water discharges,The number of permitted waste water management discharge sites within a watershed.,"Waste water discharge from municipal and industrial sources can impact water quality in salmon habitats through either chemical contamination, which can directly injure or kill aquatic life, or excessive nutrient enrichment (eutrophication), which can result in dissolved oxygen depletion in water bodies and suffocate aquatic organisms."
