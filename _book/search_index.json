"],["executive-summary.html", "Chapter 1 Executive Summary", " Chapter 1 Executive Summary Throughout British Columbia (BC), Canada, Pacific salmon and steelhead play a vital part in the province’s culture, ecology, and economy. They provide food, social, and economic benefits to coastal communities and support significant commercial and recreational fisheries throughout the region. Canada’s wild Pacific salmon populations are comprised of 430 ecologically, geographically, and genetically distinct groups– defined as Conservation Units (CUs) under Canada’s Wild Salmon Policy – which represent unique spawning populations that occur throughout BC and the Yukon. This abundance of CUs represents an important piece of all salmon biodiversity within Canada. While some salmon and steelhead populations in BC and the Yukon are doing well, others are degraded, declining, or of conservation concern. However, for many populations, we know very little about their current status or the state of their essential freshwater habitats. The ability to maintain salmon and steelhead biodiversity depends, in part, on the ability to detect changes in salmon and steelhead production over time. This type of information helps to diagnose the drivers of salmon and steelhead population dynamics and identify when and where conservation and management measures are needed to reverse declines. In BC, however, our current ability to make salmon-focused and evidence-based decisions is hindered by the lack of timely and broadly available information on the status of salmon and steelhead CUs. To strengthen the baseline of information for salmon and steelhead in BC, the Pacific Salmon Foundation (PSF) works with First Nations, Federal, Provincial, and Regional Governments, and local independent salmon and steelhead experts and knowledge holders to evaluate the status of salmon and steelhead populations. We work with these groups via regional technical committees and Science Advisory Committees to compile the best available data for describing the characteristics, dynamics, and status of salmon and steelhead CUs as well as their freshwater habitats throughout BC. Using this information, we evaluate both ‘biological status’ (the degree of conservation concern) and ‘habitat status’ (the risk of degradation posed by multiple human and environmental pressures) for each salmon and steelhead CU. These biological and habitat status assessments form the core of the Pacific Salmon Explorer our online data visualization tool for open access, up-to-date, and centralized salmon and steelhead information. To assess biological status, we compile and synthesize information from several datasets that characterize key salmon and steelhead population dynamics and temporal trends in fisheries data. These include spawner surveys, observed spawner counts, juvenile surveys, estimates of CU spawner abundance, estimates of total run size, U.S. and Canadian catch, exploitation rate, hatchery release data, and recruits-per-spawner datasets. We then apply a standardized approach to assessing the biological status of each CU, by comparing the current estimated CU spawner abundance, against upper and lower spawner-recruitment or percentiles benchmarks that we derive using a set of decision rules to determine that benchmark most appropriate given the data. A CU is then assigned a “red” status if the current spawner abundance is at or below the lower benchmark. An “amber” status is assigned if the current spawner abundance is above the lower benchmark and at or below the upper benchmark. A “green” status is assigned if current spawner abundance is above the upper benchmark. In all Regions, data limitations for some CUs mean that we are unable to assess the current biological status; therefore, we categorize these CUs as ‘data deficient.’ For the ~10% of CUs in BC that have status assessments completed by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC), and/or by the Province of BC. We also display the outcome of these status assessments in the Pacific Salmon Explorer. Due to the release of hatchery-produced salmon and steelhead in rivers and streams throughout BC, we apply standardized approaches based on DFO methods to assess the current Hatchery Releases (High, Moderate, Low, None, Not Assessed) for salmon and steelhead CUs. Given that the quality of salmon and steelhead data varies among Regions, species, CUs, and streams, we also apply a standardized approach to assess the quality of data used to estimate spawner abundance and catch for each CU based on a set of criteria outlined in this report. Data for a given CUs was then rated as Poor, Fair, or Good. Evaluations of Hatchery Releases and data quality are essential to determine the level of confidence a user should have when interpreting biological data and status assessments for salmon and steelhead CUs. To assess habitat status and evaluate individual and cumulative pressures on freshwater salmon and steelhead habitat, we use 12 habitat pressure indicators (forest disturbance, equivalent clearcut area, insect and disease defoliation, riparian disturbance, road development, water licenses, stream crossing density, total land cover alteration, impervious surfaces, linear development, mining development, and wastewater discharges). We quantify the extent and intensity of each indicator above in every salmon-bearing watershed in BC. To date, PSF and our collaborators have undertaken biological and habitat status assessments for salmon and steelhead CUs within the Skeena, Nass, Central Coast, Fraser, Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets, Columbia, and Haida Gwaii Regions in BC. We assessed the biological status of 339 of the 370 salmon and steelhead CUs within these seven Regions. Sixty percent of CUs in these Regions are considered data deficient, and two percent are extinct. A key output of this work is the development of baseline information on the status of salmon and steelhead populations and their habitats throughout BC. All of the data and assessments developed through this work are integrated into the Pacific Salmon Explorer, an online data visualization tool that displays information on salmon and steelhead populations and their habitats in the Skeena, Nass, Central Coast, Fraser, Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets, Columbia, and Haida Gwaii Regions. The source datasets are also freely available to the public via our Salmon Data Library. "],["introduction.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction In Canada, data on Pacific salmon and steelhead are not readily accessible, synthesized in a centralized location, kept up to date, or used to assess biological or habitat status in a standardized way. In the absence of a common baseline understanding of the status of specific salmon and steelhead populations, it is difficult to make informed, transparent, and evidence-based management and conservation decisions. To address this challenge, the Pacific Salmon Foundation’s (PSF) Salmon Watersheds Program has been working since 2008 to improve access to timely information on the biological status of wild salmon and steelhead and pressures on their freshwater habitats through the Pacific Salmon Explorer, an interactive data visualization tool, and a Salmon Data Library. With these tools, we seek to improve access to information in a centralized location, visualize this information in an engaging and useful manner, and inform decision-making processes for salmon and steelhead conservation and management. There are several reasons why we are leading this work. First, there is a lack of standardized, readily accessible information about salmon and steelhead and their freshwater habitats. For example, this work evolved from initial processes undertaken in the Skeena watershed, where a lack of understanding of the state of salmon and their habitats resulted in conflict among management agencies and user groups in regard to fisheries management challenges and potential solutions. Second, this lack of information makes it difficult to determine when and where management actions are needed to improve the status and abundance of salmon and steelhead populations. Third, limited resources and capacity often result in managers and decision-makers prioritizing where to invest limited resources in the conservation and management of Pacific salmon and steelhead. By understanding salmon and steelhead population status and potential threats to their freshwater habitats, people can better understand what actions might improve outcomes for salmon and steelhead and where those may be best applied. Providing timely and open-access information can inform strategic planning initiatives for salmon and steelhead. The overarching goal of this work is the democratization of information to support science-based conservation and management decisions for salmon and steelhead. The main objectives of this work are to: Strengthen baseline scientific information for Pacific salmon and steelhead and their habitats, Provide timely and standardized assessments of biological status of wild Pacific salmon and steelhead and pressures on freshwater salmon and steelhead habitats in BC and the Yukon, Make information about Pacific salmon and steelhead and their habitats broadly accessible, and Support efforts to integrate this work into conservation, management, and strategic planning initiatives for salmon and steelhead in BC and the Yukon. To meet these objectives, the methods that we apply to assess biological and habitat statuses are consistent and transferable across the Regions in the Pacific Salmon Explorer. Our overall approach is also intentionally iterative and incremental in that we seek and incorporate feedback and improvements to the analytical and communications work that we do. As such, any data that we include in the Pacific Salmon Explorer must be consistently collected, available at broad spatial scales, accompanied by detailed documentation, and allow for reproducibility of analyses (e.g. through code and automation). Finally, for this work to inform conservation, management, and strategic planning efforts, we continue to support and engage in social processes that improve awareness, application, and development of the Pacific Salmon Explorer. Our efforts to assess biological and habitat status align with Canada’s Wild Salmon Policy (DFO, 2005), a science-based framework for monitoring wild Pacific salmon biodiversity across BC and the Yukon. The Wild Salmon Policy seeks to maintain salmon biodiversity through the protection of Conservation Units (CUs). A CU is defined in the Wild Salmon Policy as “a group of wild salmon sufficiently isolated from other groups that, if extirpated, is very unlikely to recolonize naturally within an acceptable time frame, such as a human lifetime or a specified number of salmon generations” (DFO, 2005). Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) has defined over 400 CUs in BC and the Yukon based on similarities in their ecology, life history, and genetics (Holtby &amp; Ciruna, 2007). Protecting CUs serves to protect the minimum level of biodiversity required to maintain the resilience of salmon populations. The Wild Salmon Policy identified six strategies to apply to the conservation and management of salmon. Strategies 1 through 3 focus on improving the current understanding of salmon populations, habitats, and ecosystems through standardized assessment and monitoring. Strategies 4 through 6 focus on management and designing and implementing planning activities that use the baseline information gathered in Strategies 1-3 to manage, maintain, and rebuild salmon CUs and their habitats. The Wild Salmon Policy 2018-2022 Implementation Plan (DFO, 2018) proposed a path forward to implement these strategies. The Pacific Salmon Explorer is part of this implementation plan, understanding that the work of “maintaining and rebuilding salmon populations and their habitats” requires both DFO and effective partnerships. While steelhead were not formally included in the Wild Salmon Policy, the strategies within the policy, including monitoring biological and habitat status at a CU scale, are relevant and appropriate for steelhead, which share many similarities to Pacific salmon. Working in collaboration with First Nations, DFO, and others, we apply methods consistent with Strategies 1 and 2 of the Wild Salmon Policy to assess the biological and habitat status of salmon and steelhead CUs. We provide these assessments across Regions delineated by PSF according to watershed and CU boundaries. This technical report provides a detailed overview of our approach and analytical methodologies as a reference document for the Pacific Salmon Explorer. Up-to-date status assessments and data are accessible within this online tool. In the following sections of this report, we detail our general approach, the Regions of BC and Yukon within which we work, our analytical approach, and detailed Region-specific methodologies. We will update this report as data sources, methods, and approaches evolve. "],["general-approach.html", "Chapter 3 General Approach 3.1 Regions in the Pacific Salmon Explorer", " Chapter 3 General Approach To democratize salmon and steelhead data and inform decision-making for salmon and steelhead conservation and management, we have developed two online tools: 1) the Pacific Salmon Explorer and 2) the Salmon Data Library. These tools provide access to baseline information on salmon and steelhead CUs in BC and the Yukon, assessments of biological status of salmon and steelhead CUs, and descriptions of pressures on freshwater habitats within CUs across broad spatial scales. Our aim is to establish a legacy of information to inform evidence-based decision-making for salmon and steelhead conservation and management and help identify opportunities for supporting the recovery of at-risk CUs. The Pacific Salmon Explorer is a novel online data visualization tool where information about salmon and steelhead CUs and their habitats is freely and publicly available. The Pacific Salmon Explorer was built by Periscopic Inc. using HTML5 technologies and is driven by a PostgreSQL database developed and maintained by PSF staff. The Pacific Salmon Explorer was initially launched in June 2016, including only the Skeena Region. Since the Pacific Salmon Explorer was developed with extensibility in mind, we added additional Regions to the tool (see Section 5. Regions: Specific Data, Methods, and Results). We will continue to add additional Regions to the tool until all salmon and steelhead CUs in BC and the Yukon are included. The Salmon Data Library is a centralized database that hosts all data visualized in the Pacific Salmon Explorer, along with other relevant data on salmon and steelhead and their habitats in BC. This database, which houses both spatial and non-spatial data, can be accessed via links from the Pacific Salmon Explorer and directly via a URL (data.salmonwatersheds.ca). The interface allows the public to access and search the database online, explore the metadata records for each dataset, and download the datasets directly. In instances where we use an existing publicly available dataset, we provide links to the source data (e.g. to DataBC) so that users can access the most up-to-date authoritative dataset. All non-public datasets available on the Salmon Data Library were shared with PSF with permission and in accordance with relevant data sharing agreements. Using these two tools, we focus on the following five strategies to achieve our overarching objectives of strengthening and improving access to baseline scientific information for salmon and steelhead CUs: Compile the best available existing data for Pacific salmon and steelhead populations and their habitats; Provide data summaries for each CU, including information on abundance, harvest, run-timing, productivity, and trends; Use a suite of indicators to assess the biological status of CUs and the risk of degradation to freshwater salmon and steelhead habitats from individual and cumulative pressures; Visualize all of the data and assessments on the Pacific Salmon Explorer; and Make all datasets broadly and freely available via our Salmon Data Library. Our approach includes both an analytical component and a social process. First, we invest time and effort to synthesize information on biological and habitat indicators using standardized methodologies. Second, we work with First Nations, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, and other salmon and steelhead experts from non-profit organizations, the Province of BC, municipalities, and independent scientists to solicit feedback and input in order to improve and adapt our approach. The collaborative nature of this approach involves technical committees within each Region whom we meet with through a series of technical review meetings and specific Advisory Committees who offer advice on our analytical approach. Technical committees are our primary forum for engaging technical review within each region and include fisheries, natural resource, and stewardship experts from First Nations, DFO, the Provincial government, communities, and non-government organizations. Technical committees play a critical role in grounding our analyses in local knowledge and expertise. By providing guidance on the project methodology and approach, technical committees also help ensure that results are relevant to local and regional decision-making needs. In addition to working with local project partners via technical meetings, we also engage with local community members and knowledge holders through introductory meetings, webinars, and community meetings to enable a review of spawning locations and provide additional feedback on our overall approach. We also solicit feedback from salmon and steelhead experts from DFO, the Province of BC, academia, and other organizations to develop our analytical approach and improve specific methodology. Since 2018, our Population Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) has helped guide our analytical approach for assessing biological status and developing biological indicators and the visualization of this information in the Pacific Salmon Explorer. We formed the PSAC during our work to add the Fraser Region and Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets to the Pacific Salmon Explorer (during 2018-2020), but their guidance applies broadly to all Regions. The Salmon Watersheds Program has also developed a Habitat Science Advisory Committee (HSAC), which provides advice on the data sources, analytical approach, and visualization of the habitat pressure indicators and habitat assessments in the Pacific Salmon Explorer. In some cases, we have also formed focused working groups to address case-specific issues that require further consideration. For example, we formed a Southern BC Chinook Technical Working Group in collaboration with DFO to help guide our approach to synthesizing data and assessing biological status of Southern BC Chinook (Korman and English, 2013; Brown et al., 2020). During the integration of steelhead data into the Pacific Salmon Explorer (during 2021-2023), we formed a Steelhead Technical Working Group composed of steelhead experts from the Province of BC, First Nations, academia, and other organizations to review and inform our approach to presenting data and status assessments for steelhead at a CU scale. 3.1 Regions in the Pacific Salmon Explorer Our intent is to complete and maintain assessments of biological status and pressures on freshwater habitats across all salmon and steelhead CUs in British Columbia and the Yukon. As of 2023, we have applied our approach to three major salmon and steelhead-bearing watersheds within BC (the Skeena, Nass, and Fraser Rivers), as well as a number of smaller watersheds that drain into the Pacific Ocean along the Central Coast, North Coast, Haida Gwaii, Vancouver Island and southern mainland inlets of BC, and the upper reaches of the Columbia River within Canada. In the near future, we aim to apply our approach to the last remaining Pacific Regions, which include the salmon and steelhead-bearing watersheds along the transboundary region with Alaska (i.e. Unuk, Stikine, Whiting, Taku, Chilkat, Alsek) and those within the Yukon Territory. For these assessments, we have delineated assessment Regions that are unique to our approach (Figure 3.1). Many salmon and steelhead CUs span a diversity of watershed, social, political, and administrative borders; therefore, it is not generally possible to fit CUs within well-known regional boundaries. By identifying Regions with geographic boundaries primarily based on CU boundaries, we have prioritized the ecological and genetic similarities among salmon and steelhead populations that make up CUs as our regional borders. In addition to CU boundaries, we also consider the adjacency of a Region to past and future study Regions to minimize regional overlap and consider major drainage patterns represented by the BC Freshwater Atlas 1:20,000 Watershed Groups. Figure 3.1: Salmon-bearing regions covered by the Pacific Salmon Explorer. 3.1.1 Conservation Units in the Pacific Region within the Pacific Salmon Explorer In the Pacific Region (British Columbia and the Yukon), CUs are defined by DFO according to the methodology developed by Holtby and Ciruna (2007) to describe the genetic diversity of wild salmon. In total, 430 CUs were identified across BC and the Yukon (Holtby &amp; Ciruna, 2007; Appendix 1). Since developing the Pacific Salmon Explorer, we have based our lists of CUs on this original list (Holtby and Ciruna, 2007) and incorporated expert guidance from our technical committees to refine these lists (see Section 5. Regions for specific details). Given that new information has continued to become available since that initial list, in 2019, DFO released a structured framework for reviewing and approving revisions to the current list of CUs (Wade et al., 2019). This process recognizes the need for a formalized process for reviewing and updating CUs in a standardized and consistent manner. "],["analytical-approach.html", "Chapter 4 Analytical Approach Using Indicators to Inform the Status of Salmon and Steelhead Conservation Units and their Habitats 4.1 Biological Status: Indicators &amp; Benchmarks 4.2 Habitat Status: Indicators &amp; Benchmarks 4.3 Reporting Status Across Spatial Scales", " Chapter 4 Analytical Approach Using Indicators to Inform the Status of Salmon and Steelhead Conservation Units and their Habitats We apply a suite of indicators to assess both the biological and habitat status of salmon and steelhead CUs. Defined as “measures of pressures, states, and/or responses”, indicators depict the condition of species, habitats, and/or systems to improve one’s understanding of the linkages among drivers, stressors, conditions, and management actions (ESSA, 2020). The indicators and approach that we use align with Strategies 1 and 2 of the Wild Salmon Policy (DFO, 2005) that call for standardized assessment and monitoring of the salmon CUs and their freshwater habitats (Holt et al., 2009; Stalberg et al., 2009). Relevant salmon and steelhead indicators for informing biological and habitat status have several criteria: They are measurable, relevant to the health and persistence of salmon and steelhead as they characterize either key population dynamics or habitat conditions; The data are available over broad spatial and temporal scales; The data are updated consistently; The data have consistent collection protocols; The data are in a format that allows easy integration into PSF’s data systems; The indicators can be tracked over time; They can be used to inform management decisions for threatened or at-risk salmon and steelhead CUs. To quantify the suite of biological and habitat status indicators that we use, we have continued to lead a major effort to compile and synthesize salmon and steelhead-related data in each of the Regions where we operate. While a large amount of salmon and steelhead-related data already exists, they are often not readily available, not well documented, and not compiled in a single location. Our efforts focus on bringing existing information together in a standardized format into a single, centralized location (i.e. the Salmon Data Library) and summarizing the data in valuable ways for monitoring and assessing salmon and steelhead CUs and their habitats (i.e. the Pacific Salmon Explorer). We then calculate and apply benchmarks for each indicator to assess status using a ‘stoplight’ approach. The result is a qualitative assessment of each indicator as either red, amber, or green, depending on the current data relative to a lower or upper benchmark (Figure 4.1). The intent is that decision-makers can then apply management measures to improve the status of a CU and/or salmon-bearing watershed, for example, from Red to Amber or Amber to Green (DFO, 2005). Figure 4.1: Benchmarks and biological status zones under the Wild Salmon Policy (DFO, 2005). 4.1 Biological Status: Indicators &amp; Benchmarks The biological status assessments that we complete and visualize on the Pacific Salmon Explorer are guided by the approaches recommended under Strategy 1 of the Wild Salmon Policy (DFO, 2005) and by Holt et al. (2009), as well as additional recommendations from our independent Population Science Advisory Committee. Candidate benchmarks for evaluating the status of CUs have been proposed for four classes of indicators (Holt et al., 2009), which include: Current spawner abundance; Trends in spawner abundance over time; Distribution of spawners within the CU; and Fishing mortality relative to stock productivity. We assess biological status using a metric of current spawner abundance, while providing information on other indicators where available. To characterize key salmon and steelhead population dynamics, temporal trends in fisheries data, and assess the biological status of salmon and steelhead CUs across the Pacific Region, we compile and synthesize the following information: spawner survey locations, observed spawner counts in indicator and non-indicator streams, juvenile surveys in streams, estimates of spawner abundance at the CU-level, estimates of total run size, U.S. and Canadian catch, exploitation rate, hatchery release data, and recruits-per-spawner datasets. The data sources and analyses differ among regions, with the main differences occurring between the North and Central Coast (Nass, Skeena, Central Coast Regions) and the South Coast (Fraser and Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets Regions). Region-specific data nuances are included in Regions. We synthesize the types of data listed above to generate output datasets that are available for download in the Salmon Data Library. These output datasets are visualized in the Pacific Salmon Explorer through nine population indicators, as well as accompanying information on the extent of hatchery influence and quality of data for each CU in the Hatchery Release Score and Data Quality Scores, respectively. The data compilation exercise also highlights data gaps across and within Regions. We aim to update these key datasets annually or as new input data become available. 4.1.1 Overview of Biological indicators We use nine indicators to characterize the population status of each Conservation Unit in the Pacific Salmon Explorer. Spawner Surveys Juvenile Surveys Hatchery Releases Spawner Abundance Run Timing Catch and Run Size Recruits-per-Spawner Trends in Spawner Abundance Biological Status These indicators provide information on the current state of salmon and steelhead CUs and trends over time. The first three indicators involve displaying stream-level information organized by CU. The last seven indicators involve synthesizing data at the CU-level, with the Hatchery Release indicator involving both the stream-level release data and a CU-level Hatchery Release Score. Here, we describe the general approach to compile and synthesize data for each of these biological indicators. Detailed methods that depend on the specifics of the available data vary by Region and are documented in the Regions section. 4.1.1.1 Spawner Surveys Spawner surveys show the observed numbers of spawning salmon of each species returning to specific streams each year. Spawner surveys provide a fundamental piece of information needed to assess the status of salmon CUs over time. We draw on spawner survey data from the New Salmon Escapement Database (NuSEDS) and other sources detailed in the region Regions section to visualize the spatial and temporal coverage of spawner surveys for each CU in the Pacific Salmon Explorer. We distinguish spawner surveys in indicator streams and non-indicator streams for each species. Indicator streams are observed more consistently in recent decades, tend to have higher spawner abundance and to be monitored using more intensive methods that provide greater accuracy. Therefore, indicator streams are understood to provide more reliable indices of abundance and are assumed to be representative of returns to other streams nearby (English et al. 2016). Non-indicator streams tend to have less consistent survey coverage, more variable survey methods, and/or may be more difficult to survey. A number of both indicator and non-indicator streams within a CU may be surveyed in a given year. On the Pacific Salmon Explorer, we use the indicator stream designation from LGL Ltd (English et al., 2018) for the North and Central Coast Regions (Skeena, Nass, and Central Coast), and the indicator stream designation provided by DFO in NuSEDS for all other Regions. A variety of methods are used to survey spawners in both indicator and non-indicator streams, and methods vary by species, CU, and stream. Spawner counts can be produced from a single visual survey of a stream by foot, by counting fish through a complete counting fence, or by aerial (helicopter) surveys. Survey methodology can also change over time according to changes in capacity and funding. For instance, some streams that were historically monitored by visual surveys on foot are now enumerated via a counting fence or aerial surveys (see Data Quality section below). 4.1.1.2 Juvenile Surveys Estimates of Juvenile abundance indicate the number of out-migrating smolts that were counted in a given year for each stream within a CU (where available). We also calculate the geometric mean of juvenile abundance or density as it is less sensitive to infrequent high abundance years. 4.1.1.3 Hatchery Releases While salmon hatcheries can play a role in the conservation and management of Pacific salmon, hatchery releases can also pose risks to wild salmon and steelhead. Juvenile hatchery fish can out compete wild juveniles for limited food resources, and there is increasing evidence that high hatchery salmon abundance at sea is related to decreased wild salmon productivity due to limitations of ocean carrying capacity (Ruggerone &amp; Irvine, 2018; Connors et al., 2020). Hatchery-produced spawners can also reproduce with wild salmon and steelhead, with implications for genetic diversity and productivity of wild populations. Hatchery-produced fish can also exacerbate issues in mixed-stock fisheries, which can affect threatened or at-risk salmon and steelhead populations. Given these concerns and other potential impacts of hatcheries on wild salmon and steelhead abundance and productivity, we visualize the number of fry released from specific locations under the hatchery releases indicator. For each hatchery facility (i.e. the facility where eggs are hatched), we show the name, years in use, and facility type. Hatchery operations range in size and production from small to large-scale, with different purposes. There are four types of hatcheries shown on the Pacific Salmon Explorer, as defined by Fisheries and Oceans Canada’s Salmon Enhancement Program (Table 4.1) Hatchery facilities may release juvenile fish at one or more release sites. We show the locations and numbers of fish released through time at each of these release sites. Locations also include additional information: the name of the site, the years that site was in use, the type or life stage at which juvenile salmon or steelhead were released, and the broodstock CU (CU from which the hatchery broodstock originates). Juvenile salmon and steelhead are released at various life stages and under various hatchery practices (e.g. some juveniles are released in rivers as fed fry, while others are reared for longer in the hatchery and then transferred to a sea pen in the ocean, where they are eventually released) which can affect their survival (James et al. 2023). Pacific salmon data on hatchery locations, release sites, and release numbers were provided by DFO Salmon Enhancement Program staff. For steelhead, these data were accessed through the Province of BC’s BC Data Catalogue. The information on hatchery releases in streams is also synthesized at the CU-level (see Hatchery Releases Score, below). Table 4.1: Types of Hatcheries operated in BC and visualized on the Pacific Salmon Explorer. Type of Hatchery Description Enhancement operations Major hatcheries with high production Community economic development Smaller-scale community-based hatcheries Designated public involvement Similar to community economic development but smaller Public involvement unit Very small-scale hatcheries 4.1.1.4 Spawner Abundance We visualize both observed and estimated spawner abundance on the Pacific Salmon Explorer. This indicator provides estimates of the total numbers of spawners that return to spawn each year for each CU. Observed spawner abundance is the sum of all spawner survey data as documented in NuSEDS, while estimated spawner abundance generally accounts for streams that are not surveyed in a given year by following expansion procedures. The approach for expanding from observed spawners to estimate the total spawners in a CU depends on the region and species, and are documented in the Regions section. Unless specified otherwise, estimated CU-level spawner abundance is used as input in the Catch and Run Size, Recruits-per-Spawner, and Trends in Spawner Abundance indicators described below and when assessing biological status for each CU (see Appendix 4). 4.1.1.5 Run Timing Run timing is estimated using a range of methods, including models based on daily counting fence data to expert judgment reporting mean and standard deviation of the annual return time for each CU. Where these data are available, we visualize the estimated run timing as a normal distribution for each CU. 4.1.1.6 Catch &amp; Run Size Catch estimates report the number of adult salmon or steelhead caught in commercial (including both Canadian and U.S.), recreational, and First Nations’ food, social, and ceremonial (FSC) fisheries. Run Size refers to the number of adult salmon or steelhead that return from the ocean in a given year, including both escapement (i.e. estimated spawner abundance) and those that are caught (i.e. catch) at a CU-level. The exploitation rate is calculated as the proportion of a given run caught in all fisheries. This indicator provides important information on the long-term harvest rate of each CU, which has implications for the number of salmon and steelhead returning to spawning grounds over time. 4.1.1.7 Recruits-per-Spawner Recruits-per-spawner estimates the number of adult salmon produced per spawner in the previous generation. This indicator provides valuable information on the recruitment of salmon or steelhead within a CU when calculations are available over the long term. This can improve our understanding of survival within and among CUs. If the number of recruits-per-spawner is below one, the population will decline over time. For species with variable age-at-return, estimating the number of recruits for a given brood year requires information on total run size (i.e. catch plus escapement) and the distribution of ages of returning fish over multiple years. Recruits-per-spawner is then calculated as the number of recruits divided by the number of spawners for each brood year, based on CU-level estimates of spawning abundance. This indicator is relatively data-intensive as it requires information on total run size, spawner abundance, and the ages of salmon or steelhead returning to spawn. 4.1.1.8 Trends in Spawner Abundance Trends in spawner abundance is an estimate of the change in spawner abundance at the CU-level over the existing time series. This indicator highlights long-term directional changes in abundance that could otherwise be masked by high interannual variability in population abundance. When calculating trends, we take the natural logarithm of spawner abundance and smooth time series using a one-generation moving average, which minimizes the impact of outliers (i.e. anomalously high or low abundance years) on the overall trend (d’Eon-Eggerston et al., 2015). On the Pacific Salmon Explorer, we show the linear trend in log-transformed spawner abundance over the entire time series of available data, as well as the trend over the most recent three generations, which aligns with the quantitative for status assessments by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). Assuming the data are reliable, considering trends in population abundance over longer time periods may be more likely to detect true changes in abundance and trigger an appropriate management response (d’Eon-Eggerston et al., 2015; Porszt et al., 2012). 4.1.1.9 Biological Status The assessment of biological status is more involved, and our approach to quantifying metrics and benchmarks is detailed in section Benchmarks for Assessing Biological Status. 4.1.2 Hatchery Release Score Hatchery-produced salmon and steelhead are released in streams throughout BC, resulting in salmon and steelhead populations that are considered to be hatchery-produced to varying degrees. We assess and display the current Hatchery Releases Score for salmon and steelhead CUs based on a standardized approach that draws on the best available data for all spawning streams within CUs across BC. The Hatchery Release Score is an assessment of the extent of hatchery activity within a CU over the last two generations. Table 4.2: Stream Hatchery Releases score categories for spawning streams. Stream Enhancement Level Definition None No records of enhancement Low No records of enhancement over the previous two generations Moderate Less than 25% enhancement over the previous two generations High More than 25% enhancement over the previous two generations Not Assessed The Enhancement Level for this Conservation Unit has not been assessed The determination of a CU’s Hatchery Release Score begins with assessing the extent of hatchery influence among individual spawning streams (indicator and non-indicator) within that CU, based on methods developed by DFO (Brown et al., 2019, 2020). Assessments of stream-level hatchery influence may draw on three types of information: 1) the number of coded wire tags (CWT) recovered from spawners; 2) the number of juveniles released from hatcheries within the CU; and 3) the number of fish collected for broodstock. If CWT-based estimates are available, then we use the proportion of returning spawners that have CWTs to quantify stream-level hatchery influence. Otherwise, we use the highest number from either the number of juvenile releases or the number of collected broodstock. This information is used to assign a categorical assessment of stream-level hatchery influence (high, moderate, low, none, not assessed; Table 4.2). For example, if more than 25% of spawners have CWTs, or more than 25% of years have records of juvenile releases or broodstock collection, then the stream is ranked as having high hatchery influence (Table 4.2). Data on hatchery activities for each spawning stream for southern BC Chinook were provided by DFO (Brown et al., 2019, 2020). For other species and CUs, we assessed stream-level hatchery influence based on data provided by the DFO’s Salmon Enhancement Program. In contrast to Brown et al. (2019), we assessed stream-level hatchery influence over the most recent two generations in alignment with the definition of wild salmon under Canada’s Wild Salmon Policy. To arrive at a CU-level Hatchery Release Score, we calculate the proportional contribution, \\(c\\), of spawners from streams with moderate or high stream-level hatchery influence to the total spawners in each CU: \\[ c = \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in H}{\\bar{S}_i}}{\\sum_{j = 1}^n{\\bar{S}_j}}\\] where \\(\\bar{S_i}\\) is the geometric mean number of spawners in stream \\(i\\) over the most recent two generations, \\(H\\) is the set of indices of streams that have moderate or high stream-level hatchery influence over the most recent two generations, and \\(n\\) is the total number of streams in the CU. The CU-level Hatchery Release Score is then assigned as none, low, moderate, or high based on the value of \\(c\\) (Table 4.3). Note that the distinction between none and low is related to the timeframe of hatchery releases, with a score of low indicating that there has been no records of hatchery influence (either returns of CWT spawners or releases of hatchery fish) in the most recent two generations but there are prior recrods of hatchery influence. The CU is assigned a score of not assessed if there is insufficient information to assess stream-level hatchery releases. Table 4.3: CU Hatchery Releases Scores, as generated based on the categories in Table 4.2 for individual spawning streams. Hatchery Release Score Definition None There are no records of hatchery influence in the CU Low There are no records of hatchery influence in the CU in the most recent two generations (\\(c = 0\\)) Moderate Less than 25% of spawners within the CU are from streams with moderate or high hatchery influence (\\(0 &lt; c &lt;0.25\\)) High At least 25% of spawners within the CU are from streams with moderate or high hatchery influence (\\(c \\geq 0.25\\)) Not Assessed There was insufficient information to assess stream-level hatchery influence for the CU 4.1.3 Data Quality The quality of data shown in the Pacific Salmon Explorer varies widely among Regions, species, CUs, and streams. For instance, spawner abundance obtained from a single aerial survey is less reliable than counts obtained from an unbroken counting fence. We combine spawner survey data with other datasets, such as catch, to determine total run size and to assess the biological status of CUs. The data quality for each of these data types is important contextual information when interpreting the population indicators shown in the Pacific Salmon Explorer. We developed a standardized approach to assess the quality of data used to estimate spawner abundance and catch for each CU, based on four criteria: 1) spawner survey method, 2) spawner survey coverage, 3) spawner survey execution, and 4) catch estimation method (Table 4.4). We assign scores of 0-5 to each of these four criteria and present the sum of scores over all four criteria as the overall Data Quality Score for each CU. We then translate the final scores into categories of Poor (1-7), Fair (8-14), or Good (15-20) that are displayed on the Pacific Salmon Explorer. A score of zero means that there were no data for that CU. Note that our current Data Quality Score does not consider the quality of benchmarks used to assess biological status; however, these benchmarks are derived from the above sources of data. Table 4.4: Summary of the four criteria used to assign a Data Quality Score to each CU, based on the quality of data on spawner abundance and catch estimates. Category Criteria Description Spawner Survey Data Spawner Survey Method The quality of spawner survey data, based on the survey methods and sampling effort across all indicator streams within this CU over the most recent generation Spawner Survey Data Spawner Survey Coverage How representative spawner surveys are of the CU, measured as the proportion of total spawners that spawn in indicator streams Spawner Survey Data Spawner Survey Execution How consistently the indicator streams for the CU have been surveyed, measured as the proportion of indicator streams that were monitored over the most recent generation Catch Data Catch Estimation Method The quality of recent catch estimates for the CU, based on a qualitative assessment of the rigour of the catch estimation method in the most recent generation 4.1.3.1 Spawner Survey Method This criterion indicates the quality of spawner survey data over the most recent generation, based on the survey methods and sampling effort across all indicator streams within the CU. The CU-level Spawner Survey Method data quality criteria is calculated as the average of stream-level data quality scores across all indicator streams (as defined by DFO) within the CU. We only quantify data quality for indicator streams because these are the streams that are typically used in expansion and infilling procedures to generate CU-level spawner abundances, while data for non-indicator streams are not directly used. The stream-level data quality scores that we use to calculate a CU-level Spawner Survey Method score are recorded by DFO in the NuSEDS database for each population and year. DFO measures stream-level survey quality on a six-point scale based on a standardized scoring rubric (Table 4.5) based on survey methodology and effort. These stream-level data quality scores reflect the highly variable spawner abundance data within and across spawning streams, which arises largely from differences in spawner survey methodology. To improve the communication of the stream-level data quality scores, we translate the “Estimate Classification Type” provided by DFO in NuSEDS into categories labeled as Unknown, Low, Medium-Low, Medium, Medium-High, and High (Table 4.5). Table 4.5: Stream Survey Quality Criteria for the Estimate Classification field in NuSEDS (provided by Bruce Baxter, DFO), showing our categories in the “Data Quality Score on the Pacific Salmon Explorer” column. Data Quality Score on the Pacific Salmon Explorer Estimate Type Survey Method(s) Reliability (within stock comparisons) Units Accuracy Precision High 1: True Abundance, high resolution Total, seasonal counts through fence or fishway; virtually no bypass Reliable resolution of between year differences &gt;10% (in absolute units) Absolute abundance Actual, very high Infinite (i.e. + or - 0%) Medium-High 2: True Abundance, medium resolution High effort (5 or more trips), standard methods (e.g. mark-recapture, serial counts for area under the curve, etc.) Reliable resolution of between year differences &gt;25% (in absolute units) Absolute abundance Actual or assigned estimate and high Actual estimate, high to moderate Medium 3: Relative Abundance, high resolution High effort (5 or more trips), standard methods (e.g. equal effort surveys executed by walk, swim, overflight, etc.) Reliable resolution of between year differences &gt;25% (in absolute units) Relative abundance linked to method Assigned range and medium to high Assigned estimate, medium to high Medium-Low 4: Relative Abundance, medium resolution Low to moderate effort (1-4 trips), known survey method Reliable resolution of between year differences &gt;200% (in relative units) Relative abundance linked to method Unknown assumed fairly constant Unknown assumed fairly constant Low 5: Relative Abundance, low resolution Low effort (e.g. 1 trip), use of vaguely defined, inconsistent, or poorly executed methods Uncertain numeric comparisons, but high reliability for presence or absence Relative abundance, but vague or no i.d. on method Unknown assumed highly variable Unknown assumed highly variable Low 6: Presence or Absence Any of above Moderate to high reliability for presence/absence (+) or (-) Medium to high Unknown Unknown Unknown Unknown Unknown Unknown Unknown Unknown To determine CU-level Spawner Survey Method data quality scores (\\(Q\\)), we calculate a weighted average of the stream-level survey method data quality scores across all indicator streams over the most recent generation within the CU (Table 4.6). Where there are known issues with DFO’s indicator stream list in NuSEDS, we manually override those data quality scores and substitute expert derived assessments of data quality based on expert knowledge of spawner survey methods. We do not include survey years where spawner survey methods are Unknown. We then translate the CU-level Spawner Survey Methods score into a scale of 0-5 (labeled as Not Applicable, Low, Medium-Low, Medium, Medium-High, And High; Table 4.6). Note that this score reflects the reliability of the estimates of current spawner abundance for a CU over the most recent generation and not the reliability of estimates across the entire time series. Table 4.6: CU-level Survey Quality scores. Q = CU-level survey quality score (the weighted average of the stream-level survey method data quality values for all indicator streams over the most recent generation). Score Definition 0 - Not applicable No spawner surveys were completed for this Conservation Unit over the most recent generation. 1 - Low 4.5 &lt; Q &lt; 6. Most of the spawner surveys were performed with low-effort or inconsistently executed methods, resulting in variable accuracy and precision. 2 - Medium-Low 3.5 &lt; Q &lt; 4.5. Most of the spawner surveys were performed with medium to low effort, using methods such as a stream walk, swim, or overhead flight, resulting in unknown accuracy and precision. 3 - Medium 2.5 &lt; Q &lt; 3.5. Most of the spawner surveys were performed with high effort, using methods such as a stream walk, swim, or overhead flight, resulting in medium to high accuracy and precision. 4 - Medium-High 1.5 &lt; Q &lt; 2.5. Most of the spawner surveys were performed with high effort, using methods such as mark-recapture, resulting in medium to high accuracy and precision. 5 - High 1 &lt; Q &lt; 1.5. Most of the spawner surveys produce counts of total spawners, using methods such as a fence or fishway, resulting in very high accuracy and precision. 4.1.3.2 Spawner Survey Coverage This criterion indicates how representative spawner surveys are of the entire CU, measured as the proportion of total spawners that spawn in indicator streams. If a CU has a higher proportion of spawners returning to indicator streams, we assume that the spawner abundance data within that CU is of higher quality since indicator streams are more consistently and reliably surveyed. This score is calculated as the average number of spawners in indicator streams divided by the average number of spawners in all indicator and non-indicator streams within the CU, following methods from English et al. (2018). To derive this proportion, we first determine which decade has the greatest coverage of spawner surveys across the indicator and non-indicator streams. We assume that there is a constant proportion of spawners from indicator and non-indicator streams through time. We then calculate the average number of spawners in all indicator and non-indicator streams according to: \\[C= 5 \\times \\frac{\\sum_{i - 1}^I E_{siady}}{\\sum_{i - 1}^I E_{siady} + \\sum_{j=1}^J E_{sjady}} \\] where \\(s\\) = species, \\(i\\) = indicator stream, \\(j\\) = non-indicator stream, \\(a\\) = CU, \\(d\\) = decade, \\(y\\) = year, \\(E_{siady}\\) = indicator stream escapement (i.e. spawners), by stratum, and \\(E_{sjady}\\) = non-indicator stream spawners, by stratum. This approach is used because it provides a weighted average of the actual number of spawners enumerated with higher quality methodology, rather than only counting the number of indicator and non-indicator streams. We then translate the Spawner Survey Coverage score into a scale of 0-5 (labeled as Not Applicable, Low, Medium-Low, Medium, Medium-High, and High; Table 4.7). For CUs that do not use expansion procedures to generate CU-level estimates (e.g. Fraser sockeye, Chinook, and coho, and Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets Chinook), Spawner Survey Coverage scores were generated via expert opinion. Table 4.7: Spawner survey coverage scores. Score Definition 0 - Not applicable No spawner surveys were completed for this Conservation Unit. 1 - Low 1-30% of spawners within the Conservation Unit are represented by indicator streams. 2 - Medium-Low 30-49% of spawners within the Conservation Unit are represented by indicator streams. 3 - Medium 50-69% of spawners within the Conservation Unit are represented by indicator streams. 4 - Medium- High 70-89% of spawners within the Conservation Unit are represented by indicator streams. 5 - High 90-100% of spawners within the Conservation Unit are represented by indicator streams. 4.1.3.3 Spawner Survey Execution This criterion indicates how consistently indicator streams in the CU have been surveyed over the most recent generation, measured as the proportion of monitored indicator streams. To calculate Spawner Survey Execution, we calculate the proportion of indicator streams that are surveyed within the CU in each year of the most recent generation and the generational average of the proportions for each year, according to the following formula: \\[E=\\left( \\sum_{y=Y-g+1}^{Y}\\frac{ h_y}{I} \\right) \\times \\frac{1}{g} \\times 100\\] where \\(h\\) is the number of indicator streams surveyed in year \\(y\\) of the most recent generation, \\(Y\\) is the most recent year of spawner data, \\(g\\) is the generation length, and \\(I\\) is the total number of indicator streams. We then translate the Spawner Survey Execution score into a scale of 0-5 (labeled as Not Applicable, Low, Medium-Low, Medium, Medium-High, and High; Table 4.8). Table 4.8: Spawner survey execution scores. Score Definition 0 - Not applicable No surveys were completed for this Conservation Unit over the most recent generation. 1 - Low 1-20% of all indicator streams in the Conservation Unit were surveyed each year in the most recent generation. 2 - Medium-Low 21-40% of all indicator streams in the Conservation Unit were surveyed each year in the most recent generation. 3 - Medium 41-60% of all indicator streams in the Conservation Unit were surveyed each year in the most recent generation. 4 - Medium-High 61-80% of indicator streams in the Conservation Unit were surveyed each year over the most recent generation. 5 - High 81-100% of all indicator streams in the Conservation Unit were surveyed each year in the most recent generation. 4.1.3.4 Catch Estimates Catch at the CU-level can be reconstructed using a variety of methods that result in Catch Estimates with different levels of uncertainty. This criterion indicates the quality of recent catch estimates for the CU in the most recent generation, based on a qualitative assessment of the rigor of the catch estimation method. We calculate this score at the CU-level for the most recent generation based on categories of the type of current catch datasets available on the Pacific Salmon Explorer (Table 4.9). Table 4.9: Catch estimates scores. Score Definition 0 - Not applicable No catch data are available for the Conservation Unit over the most recent generation. 1 - Low Catch is based on a proportion of catch and/or the exploitation rate in another Conservation Unit or Region (e.g. exploitation for Bella Coola-Dean River coho is assumed to be 60 % of the exploitation rate of the Skeena coho). 2 - Medium-Low Statistical area catch is divided proportionally among all Conservation Units that spawn within the statistical area according to their relative spawner abundance. 3 - Medium Catch is based on a model that is currently not reproducible or is poorly documented. 4 - Medium-High Catch is based on a peer-reviewed model of a large portion of known fisheries that the Conservation Unit is exposed to (i.e. &gt; 75% of the total catch for this Conservation Unit is expected to be accounted for in most years). 5 - High Catch is based on a peer-reviewed model of the majority of known fisheries that the Conservation Unit is exposed to (i.e. &gt; 95% of catch for this Conservation Unit is expected to be accounted for in most years). 4.1.3.5 Overall Data Quality Score We sum the scores from the four criteria above to calculate each CU’s Overall Data Quality Score. This score represents a standardized assessment of the quality of data used to estimate spawner abundance and catch for the Conservation Unit, based on the four criteria above. While this method applies to the available data, it does weigh spawner data more heavily than catch data by a ratio of 3:1. We then translate the final scores into categories of Poor (1-7), Fair (8-14), or Good (15-20) that are displayed on the Pacific Salmon Explorer (Table 4.10). A score of 0 means that there were no data to assess. Table 4.10: Overall Spawner Abundance and Catch Data Quality Scores. Sum of Scores from the four Criteria Score Displayed on the Pacific Salmon Explorer 0 Not Applicable 07-Jan Poor 14-Aug Fair 15-20 Good 4.1.4 Benchmarks for Assessing Biological Status In the Pacific Salmon Explorer, we use the current estimated spawner abundance indicator to assess biological status. In collaboration with our Population Science Advisory Committee, we have developed a set of decision rules to guide our approach to assessing biological status for salmon and steelhead CUs in the Pacific Salmon Explorer (see Decision Rules). We apply one out of two types of biological benchmarks to quantify the current biological status of CUs, depending on the best available data: (1) spawner-recruit benchmarks and (2) percentile benchmarks (Figure 4.2). Figure 4.2: Illustration of the Wild Salmon Policy status assessment framework (adapted from Holt et al., 2009). In order to determine the biological status for a given CU, we focus on the geometric mean spawner abundance (metric, blue) under the spawner abundance indicator. The status of each CU is then assessed by comparing the current spawner abundance, calculated as the geometric mean spawner abundance in the most recent generation, to the upper and lower benchmarks. The number of years in a generation is CU-specific based on information about the life-history of each CU. Where CU-specific data on age-at-return are unavailable, we assume generation lengths of 5 years for Chinook CUs, 4 years for coho CUs, 4 years for chum CUs, and 4 years for sockeye CUs. Pink salmon have a consistent 2-year age-at-return and because even- and odd-year lineages are considered separate CUs, the most recent spawner abundance is simply the most recent year’s estimated spawner abundance for this species. A CU is assigned a red status if the current spawner abundance is at or below the lower benchmark, an amber status if the current spawner abundance is above the lower benchmark and at or below the upper benchmark, and a green status if it is above the upper benchmark. As spawner-recruit benchmarks consider both productivity and carrying capacity of each CU, they are more biologically meaningful, and we aim to apply them whenever possible. However, spawner-recruit benchmarks require spawner abundance and additional data at the CU-level (e.g. age structure and exploitation rates) that may not be available for a given CU. When these data are not available, we calculate benchmarks based on percentiles of historical spawner abundance, referred to as percentile benchmarks. Percentile benchmarks have been shown to approximate spawner-recruit benchmarks (Holt et al., 2018). Except for specific cases (detailed below), they can be a suitable alternative to spawner-recruit benchmarks when the necessary data to estimate spawner-recruit curves are unavailable. 4.1.4.1 Spawner-Recruit Benchmarks We use a Ricker model to describe the spawner-recruit relationship and define associated benchmarks: \\[R_{i,t} = S_{i,t} \\exp(a_i - b_i S_{i,t}) \\] where \\(R_{i,t}\\) is the number of recruits for CU \\(i\\) and brood year \\(t\\), \\(S_{i,t}\\) is the total number of spawners for CU \\(i\\) in year \\(t\\), \\(a_i\\) is the CU-level productivity parameter that describes the population growth at low spawner abundance, and \\(b_i\\) is the density-dependence parameter. A target reference point commonly applied in fisheries is the number of spawners that produces maximum sustainable yield, or \\(S_{MSY}\\), where yield is \\(Y = R - S\\). This can be calculated from the above Ricker equation given parameters \\(a\\) and \\(b\\): \\[ S_{MSY} = \\frac{1-W(e^{1-a})}{b}\\] where \\(W\\) is the Lambert W function (Scheuerell 2016). Following recommendations under Canada’s Wild Salmon Policy, we apply an upper spawner-recruit benchmark equal to \\(S_{MSY}\\) (Holt et al., 2009). Subsequent work by DFO has recommended a lower (i.e. less precautionary) benchmark of 80% \\(S_{MSY}\\) to have the Wild Salmon Policy biological status assessments be consistent with other fisheries management plans. Although PSF adopted this change to 80% \\(S_{MSY}\\) for the period 2020-2023, we have since reverted to the original, and more precautionary, upper benchmark of \\(S_{MSY}\\). The lower spawner-recruit benchmark \\(S_{GEN}\\) is the spawner abundance that leads to \\(S_{MSY}\\) in one generation assuming consistent environmental conditions and no harvest. To estimate Ricker parameters \\(a_i\\) and \\(b_i\\) for each CU \\(i\\), we apply a hierarchical bayesian model to spawner-recruit data for all CUs within a species and region combination. The hierarchical model includes hyperparameters for productivity such that data-poor CUs can borrow information from data-rich CUs of the same species within the region to improve parameter estimates. Specifically, each \\(a_i\\) parameter is drawn from a normal hyperdistribution: \\[a_i \\sim N(\\mu_a, \\sigma_a) \\] where \\(\\mu_a\\) is the mean productivity among all CUs for the given region and species and \\(\\sigma_a\\) is the standard deviation in productivity parameters among CUs for the given region and species. The density-dependence parameter is estimated independently for each CU using CU-specific prior information: \\[ b_i \\sim \\text{logNormal} \\left( \\log \\left( \\frac{1}{S_{\\text{max},i}} \\right), \\sigma_{b,i} \\right) \\] where \\(S_{\\text{max},i}\\) is the maximum spawner abundance for CU \\(i\\) and \\(\\sigma_{b,i}\\) is the standard deviation of \\(b_i\\) for CU \\(i\\). Estimates of \\(S_{\\text{max},i}\\) from habitat capacity were used as an informative prior where available. To date, habitat capacity data has only been available for lake-type sockeye CUs. If habitat capacity data are available and its use is supported by published literature and expert opinion, we use this information to estimate \\(S_{\\text{max},i}\\) as an informative prior on \\(b_i\\). If these data are unavailable, we use \\(S_{\\text{max},i} = 1 / \\hat{S}_{\\text{max},i}\\) where \\(\\hat{S}_{\\text{max},i}\\) is the maximum observed spawner abundance for CU \\(i\\). We estimate parameters \\(a_i\\) and \\(b_i\\) for each CU \\(i\\) by fitting the linearized Ricker model to spawner and recruit data: \\[ \\log \\left( \\frac{R_{i,t}}{S_{i,t}} \\right) = a_i - b_i S_{i,t}\\] where \\(a_i\\) is drawn from a region/species hyperdistribution as described above, with priors \\(\\log (\\mu_a) \\sim N(0.5, 1000)\\), \\(\\sigma_a = \\sqrt(1/\\tau_a)\\) where \\(\\tau_a \\sim \\text{Gamma}(0.5, 0.5)\\). Estimates of \\(\\sigma_{b,i}\\) are unique to each CU and [to be filled in]. The above linearized Ricker model is fit to all CUs for a given region and species together using the R package R2jags (Su and Yajima 2021), with a total number of iterations of 100,000, removing 5000 iterations for burnin and applying a thinning interval of 10. The resulting posterior draws for \\(a_i\\) and \\(b_i\\) are used to calculate posteriors for \\(S_{MSY}\\) and \\(S_{GEN}\\). The posteriors for these upper and lower benchmarks are summarized by calculating the highest posterior density (HPD) and 95% highest posterior density interval (HPDI). We chose to use these summary statistics instead of the mean or median because the posteriors for \\(S_{MSY}\\) and \\(S_{GEN}\\) were, in some cases, quite skewed given the tendancy for spawner abundance to be log-normally distributed. For CUs with extremely low productivity, \\(S_{GEN}\\) can be less than \\(S_{MSY}\\), yielding benchmark values that do not make biological sense (Holt et al., 2018; Peacock et al., 2020). We do not use spawner-recruit benchmarks in these cases and instead apply percentile benchmarks. Biological status of each CU is assessed by comparing the geometric mean spawner abundance over the most recent generation against upper and lower benchmarks. We compare the geometric mean spawner abundance against all posterior draws of \\(S_{MSY}\\) and \\(S_{GEN}\\) to yield a probability of a CU having each status outcome. The status colour shown on the Pacific Salmon Explorer is the most likely outcome (i.e. the one with the highest posterior probability). The HPD and 95% HPDI for the lower and upper spawner-recruit benchmarks are also shown. See Korman and English (2013) for further details, including a discussion of uncertainty and possible biases in benchmarks and status assessments derived from spawner-recruit models. 4.1.4.2 Percentile Benchmarks To quantify biological status using percentile benchmarks, we define the lower benchmark as the 25th percentile of historical spawner abundance (\\(S_{25}\\)) and the upper benchmark as the 75th percentile of historical spawner abundance (\\(S_{75}\\)), which approximates the upper spawner-recruit benchmark of \\(S_{MSY}\\) (Holt et al., 2018). We then determine the biological status of each CU by comparing the geometric mean of spawner abundance over the most recent generation to these upper and lower benchmarks. For example, a CU is assessed as red status if the current estimate of spawner abundance is at or below the 25th percentile of historical spawner abundance, amber status if the current average spawner abundance is between the 25th and 75th percentiles of historical spawner abundance, and green status if the current average spawner abundance is at or over the 75th percentile. We also generate and display 95% confidence intervals around the upper and lower percentile benchmark using a model-based computational approach that accounts for autocorrelation in the spawner abundance time series. First, we fit a simple autoregressive (AR) model to the time series of log spawner abundances for each CU to estimate the temporal autocorrelation, using the R function ar. We calculate the temporal autocorrelation. \\(\\phi_1\\), for a lag of one year, but further consideration may want to be given to including other lags. Next, we extract the residuals from the fitted series and sample from those residuals with replacement to generate \\(n\\) timeseries of bootstrapped residuals, each with length equal to the length of the original spawner abundance timeseries. Finally, we simulate \\(n\\) new time series using the estimated autocorrelation and boostrapped residuals. The equation for simulated spawner abundance timeseries is: \\[ \\log(S_{i,t}) = \\bar{S} + \\phi_1 \\left( \\log (S_{i,t-1}) - \\bar{S} \\right) + \\epsilon_{i,t} \\] where \\(S_{i,t}\\) is the simulated spawner abundance at time \\(t\\) for the \\(i\\)th simualtion, \\(\\bar{S}\\) is the mean spawner abundance as estimated from the AR model, \\(\\phi_1\\) is the temporal autocorrelation estimated from the AR model, and \\(\\epsilon_{i,t}\\) is the bootstrapped residual for simulation \\(i\\) and timestep \\(t\\). For each of the \\(n\\) simulated time series, we calculate the 25th and 75th percentiles of spawner abundance. we then take the 2.5th and 97.5th quantiles of the \\(n\\) estimates of these lower and upper benchmarks to yield boostrapped 95% confiudence intervals on \\(S_{25}\\) and \\(S_{75}\\). 4.1.4.3 Additional Status Assessments In addition to the standardized assessments of biological status developed by the Pacific salmon and steelhead Foundation, on the Pacific Salmon Explorer, we also display Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) status assessments completed by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), assessments conducted by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC), and/or assessments conducted by the Province of BC where available (Appendix 4). About 10% of salmon CUs in BC have status assessments completed by DFO for the WSP and/or by COSEWIC (COSEWIC, 2017; COSEWIC, 2018; Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 2018). Fisheries and Oceans Canada does not lead status assessments for steelhead under the WSP, but the Province of BC conducts biological status assessments for some steelhead populations under the == Provincial Framework for Steelhead Management in British Columbia (2016) ==. For steelhead CUs, we visualize the outcomes of Province of BC status These assessments apply multiple metrics and expert judgment to assess status and focus primarily on economically significant Chinook, sockeye, and coho CUs in the Fraser and south coast of BC. When available, we display the WSP and COSEWIC status assessments alongside the standardized status assessments completed by PSF. In some cases, statuses may differ between the different assessments due to varying approaches to status evaluation and/or different years of data being used. 4.1.4.4 Decision Rules for Assessing Biological Status Deciding which benchmarks are most appropriate for assessing the biological status of a given CU depends on the available data. With input from the Population Science Advisory Committee, we have developed a set of decision rules to guide how we apply benchmarks to assess biological status for all CUs on the Pacific Salmon Explorer (Figure 4.3). Figure 4.3: Flowchart for documenting decision rules for quantifying biological status. We use the following guiding questions to determine which benchmarks to apply given the available data for a CU. 1. Is there a spawner-recruit relationship available? A spawner-recruit relationship must be available to calculate spawner-recruit benchmarks. Most spawner-recruit relationships have over 10 data points (see Appendix 4). 2. Are the CU-level estimates of catch of medium-low quality or higher? Errors in estimating catch can lead to misclassification of status using spawner-recruit benchmarks (Peacock et al., 2020). As such, we do not apply spawner-recruit when CU-level catch estimates are highly uncertain (i.e. the data quality score for catch estimates is low or medium-low; see Data Quality). 3. Is there published evidence of cyclic dominance for the CU? Some CUs have population dynamics characterized by cyclic dominance (e.g. a four-year generation length that involves a dominant brood year that is most abundant, a sub-dominant brood year, followed by two brood lines with lower abundance). For these cyclic dominant CUs we do not pool data across brood lines to generate estimates of current spawner abundance or to generate CU-level benchmarks because spawner abundance is so different from year to year (Grant et al., 2020). For these CUs, we currently only visualize biological status assessments on the Pacific Salmon Explorer developed through integrated status assessments that incorporate expert judgment and quantitative modeling, where available (e.g. DFO, 2018). 4. Does the CU-level spawner abundance time series span at least 20 years? Estimates of spawner abundance over a relatively long time series are required to assess the biological status of a CU. We require a minimum of 20 years of annual estimates of spawner abundance, although we do not require that these estimates are continuous. In some cases, we may use only a subset of the available time series. We do this if expert opinion suggests that using the entire time series is not appropriate. 5. Is there a spawner abundance estimate at the CU-level for at least one year over the most recent generation? We require at least one annual estimate of spawner abundance over the most recent generation to quantify current spawner abundance. We then take the geometric mean of current spawner abundance over the most recent generation to compare to the estimated benchmarks for that CU to assess biological status. 6. Is the productivity of the CU expected to be below 2.5 and exploitation above 40%? We do not apply percentile benchmarks if productivity is low (&lt; 2.5) and fisheries exploitation is high (&gt; 40%). In these cases, percentile benchmarks can result in biological status assessments that are overly optimistic and, therefore, risky from a long-term management perspective (Holt et al., 2018; Peacock et al., 2020). For a number of CUs across all Regions, data limitations mean that we cannot assess the current biological status. In these cases, we categorize these CUs as data deficient. We consider three types of data deficiencies when assessing biological status for the Pacific Salmon Explorer. First, some CUs have no available run reconstruction and, therefore, no CU-level spawner abundance estimate. This could be because there is no data for that CU in NuSEDS, meaning there has been no record of spawner surveys conducted for the CU since 1954. This could also be because the CU does not have an identified indicator stream, which means that CU-level estimates of spawner abundance cannot be estimated, and biological status cannot be assessed. Second, some CUs may have no data on spawner abundance for the most recent generation. This means that we cannot generate an estimate of current abundance to compare against the benchmarks to assess biological status. Finally, in some cases, we may have sufficient data (i.e. run reconstructions) to assess biological status using our methods, but expert advice from our technical committees and Population Science Advisory Committee suggests that we should not assess status using our standardized approach. This can be due to the complexity of a species or CU life history (e.g. Fraser River cyclic sockeye CUs; see Fraser Region; Grant et al., 2020), other data challenges, or assumptions that are currently a barrier to applying our standardized approach. Given the iterative and incremental development approach that we take to visualizing salmon and steelhead data and assessing biological status, the current set of decision rules outlined in this technical report are subject to change to ensure that our methods align with current best practices for quantifying biological status. As such, the methods and decision rules presented here diverge from previously published PSF technical reports documenting our approach to assessing biological status in specific Regions (Connors et al., 2013; Connors et al., 2018; Connors et al., 2019). 4.1.5 Extinct, De Novo, and Transplant CUs Over time, DFO may re-classify CUs in several ways: 1) if CU-level spawner abundance declines to a point where the CU is lost (“extinct”), 2) if a CU is extinct and then re-introduced with different genetic stock (“de novo”), or 3) if a CU is created by introducing populations to a where they were not previously present (“transplant”). We visualize these categories on the Pacific Salmon Explorer, intending to maintain a historical record of Pacific salmon and steelhead’s changing genetic diversity and abundance (see Appendix 1 and Appendix 4). 4.1.6 Limitations: Biological Indicators &amp; Assessment Approach There are a number of limitations to the biological status assessments that we visualize on the Pacific Salmon Explorer. Some limitations, such as CU-level estimates of spawner abundance, developing benchmarks, and monitoring coverage, apply to all species and Regions. These caveats should be considered when interpreting the biological status assessments’ results and applying them to future research priorities. 4.1.6.1 CU-level Estimates of Spawner Abundance {cu-est-spawner-abundance} If a complete census or true count of spawners is not available for all streams within a CU, DFO applies expansion factors to generate CU-level estimates of spawner abundance. The number of indicator streams that are counted in a given year for each CU (spawner survey coverage) has been declining since the late 1990s in many Regions included in the Pacific Salmon Explorer (e.g. English et al., 2018), resulting in an increasing magnitude of this extrapolation from spawner counts at monitored streams to CU-level estimates of spawner abundance. As fewer indicator streams are used to represent what we know about spawner abundance for a potentially large and complex CU, it has become increasingly difficult to know how many spawners are returning. This could be particularly problematic if the contribution of streams within a CU as related to overall abundance changes through time. The expansion factor approach applied by DFO is generally recognized as the best practice for generating CU-level estimates of spawner abundance in many cases (e.g. on the North and Central Coast; English et al. 2012). Our work aims to derive biological status assessments of individual CUs relative to different metrics and not, for example, to set management targets or catch allocation, so the assumptions that support these expansion procedures should not overly influence this work. In addition, recent simulation analyses to determine the influence of these expansion factors on biological status assessments using our approach found that they were robust to a range of expansion procedures (Peacock et al., 2020). Peacock et al. (2020) suggest that, under certain conditions, declining monitoring coverage (to a point) has little impact on the accuracy of benchmarks or biological status assessments using our methods. We have also attempted to account for differing levels of monitoring coverage as part of our work to quantify data quality for visualization on the Pacific Salmon Explorer (see Data Quality). 4.1.6.2 Refining benchmarks We have developed the benchmarks that we apply to assess biological based on the best available recent literature and in consultation with our Population Science Advisory Committee. However, there are still alternative approaches that we could consider, and we will continue to apply best practices and our iterative approach to the application of benchmarks to deriving biological status. For example, if available, habitat-based benchmarks (e.g. Parken et al., 2006) could be applied to situations where other biological benchmarks cannot be used. 4.1.6.3 Other limitations Other limitations are species- or Region-specific; Region-specific limitations are included below in the Regions section. 4.2 Habitat Status: Indicators &amp; Benchmarks Our assessments of habitat status that we complete and visualize on the Pacific Salmon Explorer follow the approaches developed for evaluating status under Strategy 2 of the Wild Salmon Policy (DFO, 2005). Following this guidance, monitoring should be informed by information on a suite of habitat indicators. Habitat indicators provide a measure of the characteristics of the environment, such as the habitat condition, magnitude of stress, degree of exposure to a stressor, or ecological response to exposure. To evaluate the potential risk of degradation to freshwater salmon and steelhead habitat, each indicator should be relevant to salmon and steelhead and represent a clear scientific understanding of either a direct or an indirect relationship between itself and its impact on salmon and steelhead. Habitat indicators can be further described as either pressure indicators or state indicators following the two-tiered pressure and state indicator framework described by Stalberg et al. (2009). Pressure indicators are natural processes or human activities that can directly or indirectly induce qualitative or quantitative changes in environmental conditions (Stalberg et al., 2009). State indicators are physical, chemical, or biological attributes measured to characterize environmental conditions on the ground (Stalberg et al., 2009). Distinguishing features between pressure and state indicators include the scale of assessment, the resolution of input data, and the cost of assessment and monitoring. Pressure indicators are often assessed for large geographic areas using remotely sensed information. Pressure indicators evaluation and quantification of pressure indicators are less resource intensive because data collection and monitoring are typically not based on on-the-ground field studies. On the other hand, state indicators are assessed for smaller geographic areas, often require higher resolution data to evaluate and quantify, and require more resources as they often require on-the-ground fieldwork. Our work to date focuses on pressure indicators as the first step to gaining a regional-scale understanding of habitat conditions over broad geographic extents. Our intent and ambition are for these assessments of habitat pressure indicators to lead to the identification of priority areas to conduct finer-scale state indicator assessments and monitoring. Through an expert-guided process as part of our work in the Skeena Region (Porter et al., 2013a; Porter et al., 2014), we identified 12 habitat pressure indicators: forest disturbance, equivalent clearcut area, insect and disease defoliation, riparian disturbance, road development, water licenses, stream crossing density, total land cover alteration, impervious surfaces, linear development, mining development, and waste water discharges. We assess these 12 habitat indicators individually and cumulatively for every salmon and steelhead-bearing watershed in BC. 4.2.1 Scale of Habitat Assessments The base reporting unit for our assessments of habitat pressure indicators is the 1:20,000 Freshwater Atlas (FWA) assessment watersheds dataset (MOE, 2017a). The Freshwater Atlas is the most comprehensive, standardized source of hydrologic features in BC. The FWA assessment watersheds dataset is a commonly used provincial baseline dataset for resource managers, researchers, and others interested in evaluating and reporting at a watershed scale. The FWA assessment watersheds replace the legacy 1:50,000 BC Watershed Atlas Third-Order Watersheds dataset. Assessment watersheds are delineated at a scale where hillslope and channel processes are generally well linked, between 2,000 to 10,000 hectares (Carver &amp; Gray 2009). 4.2.2 Identifying salmon and steelhead Spawning Habitat Our assessment methodology uses the concept of a zone of influence (ZOI) to identify the area of land considered to influence freshwater salmon and steelhead habitat. Using ZOIs to assess salmon and steelhead freshwater habitats aligns with Strategy 2 of the Wild Salmon Policy, in that 1) the identification of habitats that support or limit salmon and steelhead production is necessary to inform assessment, monitoring, and protection priorities; and 2) that habitat requirements vary by species, life history characteristics and phase, and geography (DFO, 2005). We define ZOIs for the spawning life stage for each salmon and steelhead CU. A spawning ZOI represents the area of land that drains into the spawning habitat of a specific salmon and steelhead CU. We use the geographic extents of ZOIs to assess and quantify habitat pressures by CUs for the spawning life stage. The specific rules for defining ZOIs were developed in collaboration with PSF’s Skeena Technical Advisory Committee (Porter et al., 2013a; Porter et al., 2014) and are defined in Appendix 5 with species and Region-specific nuances, where relevant. 4.2.3 Mapping salmon and steelhead Spawning Locations We need to know where salmon and steelhead spawn to identify ZOIs and assess pressures on salmon and steelhead spawning habitats. We use spawning location data to identify and delineate salmon and steelhead spawning habitats, identify upland areas that may impact spawning habitats, and use this information to determine the relevant spatial extent for habitat assessments. We identify salmon and steelhead spawning locations using several key data sources: The Fisheries Information Summary System (FISS) database, technical reports, maps, additional databases when available, and local knowledge derived through expert elicitation. 4.2.3.1 Fisheries Information Summary System The FISS database is a legacy project which was a jointly funded initiative between BC Fisheries and DFO, intending to provide fish habitat data for water bodies throughout BC and the Yukon (MOE, 2017b). FISS data is distributed under two datasets via DataBC on the BC Data Catalogue. The two datasets, specifically, are “BC Historical Fish Distribution Zones (50,000)” and “Known BC Fish Observations and BC Fish Distributions.” The latter dataset, the Known BC Fish Observations, and BC Fish Distributions, carries the description on DataBC as “the most current and comprehensive information source on fish presence for the province.” As of 2001, the Province of BC no longer maintains the spawning zones or linear distribution dataset (“BC Historical Fish Distribution - Zones (50,000)”), but the Known BC Fish Observations and BC Fish Distributions dataset is an actively maintained dataset. This dataset houses the legacy FISS data as well as data from other provincially maintained sources. However, efforts to maintain fish location data are not standardized province-wide, and thus both data coverage and accuracy vary across BC. The province continues to document ongoing data submissions from organizations or individuals required to report fisheries data and sampling information as part of the reporting requirements for a Scientific Fish Collection Permit (a permit to capture or collect fish specimens for scientific or other non-recreational or commercial purposes). The province also documents submissions of non-permitted fish and fish habitat information on a voluntary basis. While there are some challenges with these datasets, we use these datasets as a base representation of spawning locations as these two datasets are the most comprehensive source of spawning data available province-wide. We filtered these datasets to Pacific salmon and steelhead species and spawning activity types to identify spawning locations. 4.2.3.2 Additional Technical Reports, Maps, and Databases In some Regions, we have worked with technical committees and local salmon and steelhead experts to identify additional spawning or habitat information available within technical reports, previously published maps, and other databases (see Regions. 4.2.3.3 Expert-elicited Spawning Location Information and Data Review Given the limitations of the provincially available datasets, we work with local expert knowledge holders in each Region to review and supplement the existing spawning location information using hard copy paper maps and our ESRI-based mapping platform, the salmon and steelhead Habitat Mapper (Figure 4.4). We use a structured process whereby we 1) compile large-format paper maps of each study area which include spawning location data, and 2) use the salmon and steelhead Habitat Mapper, a private online tool that we developed for exploring and contributing spawning data. Using these two tools, we work with project partners with local knowledge of where salmon and steelhead spawn in each Region to review the existing spawning location data and augment those data with additional sites of known spawning locations. These review sessions typically include both fisheries staff and community members who work with us over a day-long workshop in their local area within a Region. Any additional data documented via the large-format paper maps are then digitized and integrated, along with data collected via the salmon and steelhead Habitat Mapper, into our spawning locations dataset. Figure 4.4: salmon and steelhead Habitat Mapper: A Collaborative Tool for Mapping salmon and steelhead Spawning Habitats. 4.2.3.4 Assigning Spawning Locations to Conservation Units For all spawning location information, we assign spawning locations to individual CUs. For all species except lake-type sockeye, we assign spawning locations to CUs by determining which CU a spawning location was located within. This is done on a species-specific basis, except for pink CUs. If spawning location data sources did not differentiate between even-year or odd-year pink, we attributed that spawning location to both even-year and odd-year pink CUs in that area (where applicable). For lake-type sockeye, CU boundaries tend to be constrained to a rearing lake, so to capture the side channels where salmon and steelhead spawn, we used the rearing lake zone of influence to locate spawning areas. Where sockeye spawning locations were situated outside the lake-type sockeye spawning zone of influence, those spawning locations were assigned to the river-type sockeye CU whose boundary they were located within. 4.2.4 Overview of Habitat Pressure Indicators Once we have identified salmon and steelhead habitat and ZOIs, we use a set of habitat pressure indicators to derive coarse-scale assessments of pressures on salmon and steelhead freshwater habitats. The 12 individual habitat pressure indicators that we use allow us to quantify the potential risks to salmon and steelhead spawning habitat within each Region and CU (Table 4.11). Table 4.11: Habitat indicator definitions and their relevance to salmon and steelhead habitat. (Note that watershed refers to the Province of British Columbia’s 1:20,000 Freshwater Atlas (FWA) Assessment Watersheds.) Impact.Category Indicator Metric Definition Relevance Human Development Footprint Total Land Cover Alteration % watershed area The percentage of the total watershed area that has been altered by human activity. Total land cover alteration is a synthesis of the indicators for forest disturbance, urban land use, agriculture/rural land use, mining development, and other smaller developments. This indicator represents a suite of potential changes to hydrological processes and sedimentation, with potential impacts on salmon habitats. Mining Development # of mines The number of active and past-producing coal, mineral, or aggregate (gravel) mine sites within a watershed. The footprint of a mine and mining processes can change geomorphology and the hydrological processes of water bodies nearby. Mining can contribute to the deposition of fine sediments, which can affect salmon prey densities and salmon survival. Impervious Surfaces % watershed area The percentage of the total watershed area that is represented by hard, impervious surfaces (e.g. paved) Extensive impervious surfaces in a watershed can alter and affect natural hydrologic flow patterns and lead to stream degradation through changes in geomorphology and hydrology. They can also lead to increased nutrient loading and contaminant loads downstream. Linear Development km/km2 The density of all linear developments within a watershed, including roads, railways, utility corridors, pipelines, power lines, telecom cables, right of ways, etc. Linear development gives an indication of the overall level of development from resource activities that may affect salmon habitats. Hydrologic Processes Forest Disturbance % watershed area The percentage of total watershed area that has been disturbed by logging and burning in the last 60 years. Logging and other disturbances that reduce forest cover can change watershed hydrology by affecting rainfall interception, transpiration, and snowmelt processes. Changes over time can affect salmon habitats through altered peak flows, low flows, and annual water yields. Equivalent Clearcut Area (ECA) % watershed area The percentage of total watershed area that is considered functionally and hydrologically comparable to a clearcut forest. Landscapes that have been altered by urban, road, rail, and forestry development, as well as crown tenure, were considered. ECA reflects the pressure on salmon habitat mainly from potential increases in peak flow. Vegetation Quality Riparian Disturbance % watershed area The percentage of the riparian zone, defined as a 30m buffer around all streams, lakes, and wetlands, that have been altered by human activity in each watershed. Disturbance to riparian areas can affect salmon habitats by destabilizing stream banks, increasing surface erosion and sedimentation, reducing nutrient and woody debris inputs to water bodies, and increasing stream temperatures if streamside shading is diminished. Insect and Disease Defoliation % watershed area The percentage of pine forests that have been killed by insects or disease in each watershed. Forest defoliation from insects or disease can reduce precipitation interception, reduce transpiration, and lead to increased soil moisture. The resulting changes to peak flows and groundwater supplies can affect salmon habitats. Surface Erosion Road Development km/km2 The average density of all roads within a watershed Road development can interrupt subsurface flow, increase peak flows, and interfere with natural patterns of overland water flow in a watershed. Roads are a significant cause of increased erosion and fine sediment generation, which can impact downstream spawning and rearing habitats. Fish Passage / Habitat Connectivity Stream Crossing Density #/km The total number of stream crossings per km of the total length of modeled salmon habitat in a watershed. Stream crossings can create problems for fish passage by interfering with or blocking access to upstream spawning or rearing habitats, thus decreasing the total amount of available salmon habitat. Stream crossings can also affect water delivery to the stream network, causing increased peak flows and become a source of fine sediment delivery to streams. Water Quantity Water Licenses # of permitted water licenses The total number of water licenses permitted for water withdrawal for domestic, industrial, agricultural, power, and storage uses from points of diversion within a watershed. Heavy allocation and use of both surface and subsurface water for human use can affect salmon habitat by reducing instream flows to levels that could, at critical times of the year, limit physical access to spawning and rearing habitats or potentially expose redds. Reductions in both surface and subsurface water supply can also lead to increased water temperatures, which can impact salmon at all life stages. Water Quality Waste Water Discharges # of permitted waste water discharges The number of permitted waste water management discharge sites within a watershed. Waste water discharge from municipal and industrial sources can impact water quality in salmon habitats through either chemical contamination, which can directly injure or kill aquatic life, or excessive nutrient enrichment (eutrophication), which can result in dissolved oxygen depletion in water bodies and suffocate aquatic organisms. We developed this set of habitat pressure indicators during our initial methodology development with the Skeena Technical Advisory Committee (Porter et al., 2013a; Porter et al., 2014), building off the recommendations for monitoring and evaluation of salmon and steelhead habitats under the Wild Salmon Policy (Stalberg et al., 2009), and incorporating additional pressure indicators proposed by Nelitz et al. (2007). Some of these same indicators have been used in other habitat assessment work in the Fraser River watershed (Nelitz et al., 2011) and on the west coast of Vancouver Island (e.g. Smith &amp; Wright, 2016; Wright et al., 2011). We use specific inclusion criteria to select the datasets we use to inform these habitat pressure indicators to ensure that our methodologies are standardized across Regions. The data that we include must be: - Publicly available and readily accessible; - Created with consistent and documented data collection protocols; - Formatted to allow easy integration into our existing data systems; - Cost-effective for long-term data collection; - Reflective of both short- and long-term responses and trends in a given indicator; - Appropriate to the geographic scale of analysis; - Supported by quality assurance/quality control protocols and an established data update process. All of the data we use to inform the 12 habitat pressure indicators are sourced from publicly available provincial or federal agency databases. Most indicator data are sourced from DataBC. Additional datasets are sourced from the BC Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy, BC Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development (FLNRORD), BC Ministry of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation, as well as Natural Resources Canada. The publication year for indicator datasets is between 1992 and 2021 (see Appendix 6 for detailed descriptions and limitations, Appendix 7 for a complete listing of datasets, publication years, and data sources). We quantify each indicator at the scale of the 1:20,000 FWA assessment watersheds based on the specific units of each indicator using ArcGIS Desktop 10.8.1 and a python-scripted ArcGIS Model Builder toolbox. Data processing generally follows a process of selecting features of interest from each indicator dataset and intersecting those with FWA watersheds to quantify habitat pressures by watershed (see Appendix 8 for a complete description of processing methods for each indicator). 4.2.5 Habitat Pressure Indicator Benchmarks Similar to the biological status assessments, we quantify benchmarks for each indicator to assess habitat status. Using benchmarks allows us to categorize the risk of habitat degradation as low, moderate, or high (green, amber, or red status zones, respectively). When available, we use empirical benchmarks for habitat pressure indicators based on published literature (e.g. Stalberg et al., 2009). When empirical benchmarks are not available, we develop benchmarks based on relative distribution curves for each indicator across the full spatial extent of individual Regions on the Pacific Salmon Explorer (i.e. Fraser Region, Skeena Region, etc.; (Table 4.12)). While this approach is consistent with the recommendations of Stalberg et al. (2009), it is considered an interim approach until empirical or expert-based benchmarks become available. Table 4.12: Benchmark types for individual habitat pressure indicators. Impact.Category Indicator Metric Benchmark.Type Benchmark.Reference Human Development Footprint Total Land Cover Alteration % watershed area relative ranking (type 2) n/a Mining Development # of mines relative ranking (type 2, binary) n/a Impervious Surfaces % watershed area science-based and expert-based Paul &amp; Meyer, 2001; Smith, 2005 Linear Development km/km2 relative ranking (see Appendix 12) n/a Hydrologic Processes Forest Disturbance % watershed area relative ranking (type 2) n/a Equivalent Clearcut Area (ECA) % watershed area green/amber - science-based and expert-based; amber/red - science-based green/amber - NOAA, 1996; MOF, 2001; amber/red - Summit/MOE, 2006; FPB, 2011 Vegetation Quality Riparian Disturbance % watershed area green/amber - science-based and expert-based; amber/red - science-based green/amber - Stalberg et al., 2009; amber/red -Tripp &amp; Bird, 2004 Insect and Disease Defoliation % watershed area relative ranking n/a (see Appendix 12) Surface Erosion Road Development km/km2 green/amber - science-based and expert-based; amber/red - science-based green/amber - Stalberg et al., 2009; amber/red - MOF, 1995a,b; Porter et al., 2012 Fish Passage/Habitat Connectivity Stream Crossing Density #/km relative ranking n/a (see Appendix 12) Water Quantity Water Licenses # of permitted water licenses relative ranking (type 2, binary) n/a Water Quality Waste Water Discharges # of permitted waste water discharges relative ranking (type 2, binary) n/a We use two approaches for developing relative benchmarks, depending on the distribution of the indicator data. These approaches were developed during our initial work on habitat pressure indicators with the Skeena Technical Advisory Committee (Porter et al., 2013a; Porter et al., 2014) and were later refined to address indicators with highly skewed distributions (Porter et al., 2016). Type 1: Indicator values have symmetric or moderately skewed distributions We take this approach if habitat indicators have a symmetric or moderately skewed distribution. Using the distribution of indicator values across all Freshwater Atlas (FWA) assessment watersheds, we set the lower benchmark at the 50th percentile and the upper benchmark at the 75th percentile. This means that the “best” 50% of watersheds are considered low risk (green), the “worst” 25% of watersheds are considered high risk (red), and all other watersheds are considered at moderate risk (amber) for that pressure indicator. Type 2: Indicator values have a highly skewed distribution If habitat indicators have a highly skewed distribution, we set the lower benchmark at 0 and the upper benchmark at the statistical threshold for outlier values. Using this approach, watersheds with a 0 value are considered low risk (green), watersheds with outlier values are considered high risk (red), and all other watersheds are considered moderate risk (amber) for that pressure indicator. In some cases, the indicator values may be so highly skewed that the outlier threshold is zero. In these cases, we apply a binary approach where watersheds with a 0 value are considered low risk (green, absence), and watersheds with a value above zero are considered high risk (red, presence). This binary approach applies to the Mining Development, Water Licenses, and Waste Water Discharges indicators (Table 4.12). See Limitations section for further discussion of relative benchmark rankings. 4.2.6 Approach to Assessing Cumulative Habitat Pressures Pressures on salmon and steelhead freshwater habitats have both an individual and potential cumulative impact. We develop cumulative pressure scores for each FWA assessment watershed across CUs and Regions in the Pacific Salmon Explorer to reflect these interactions and understand the risk of habitat degradation posed by cumulative pressures. This approach allows us to visualize which CUs face the greatest potential cumulative risks to habitat conditions based on the set of pressure indicators that we assess. Cumulative scores are useful for providing a baseline to consider future risks and identify priority areas to avoid further impacts. A cumulative pressure score also provides a summary index to consider pressures on salmon and steelhead habitat in relation to the biological status of CUs. This information can help in prioritizing conservation efforts, mitigation strategies, and identifying areas for monitoring state indicators at a higher resolution. Aggregating indicators into a single, composite risk or condition score is an approach taken by a variety of programs that currently monitor watersheds in Canada and the U.S. Pacific Northwest (e.g. FLNRORD’s Forest and Range Evaluation Program, USEPA’s Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program, USDA Forest Service’s Aquatic and Riparian Effectiveness Monitoring Program). These programs use a variety of methods to aggregate their habitat data, and each approach has strengths and weaknesses (Pickard et al., 2008). Habitat indicator analyses for BC salmon and steelhead CUs (e.g. Cohen Commission analyses of Fraser sockeye CUs (Nelitz et al., 2011) and an indicator-mapping project for the Lower Thompson coho CU (Beauchamp, 2008) generated cumulative habitat stressor or impact scores based on a simple summation of all the individually scored indicators (i.e. a higher total score equates to higher risk). Habitat assessments for southern BC Chinook CUs (Porter et al., 2013b) employed an alternative approach for rating relative risk in watersheds whereby cumulative risk scoring was based on an indicator ‘roll-up’ rule set based on the proportion of the indicators that were rated low, moderate, or high risk. For the habitat pressure assessments included in the Pacific Salmon Explorer, we apply a set of roll-up rules to assign cumulative pressure scores (see Appendix 11). We calculate this cumulative pressure score for individual 1:20,000 FWA assessment watersheds within the zones of influence of all CUs. Any Region-specific idiosyncrasies are documented within the Regions section. 4.2.7 Future Resource Development Pressures In addition to assessing risks to freshwater salmon and steelhead habitats based on 12 pressure indicators, we also compile data and map information on proposed resource development projects that represent potential additional risks to salmon and steelhead and their freshwater habitats. These ‘future pressures’ are not quantitatively integrated into the habitat pressure assessments; however, we do map data on proposed resource development projects alongside current development projects in recognition of the potential impacts these activities may have on freshwater salmon and steelhead habitats and to allow for the consideration of habitat status in the siting and planning of proposed development projects. Specifically, activities related to the construction and operation of industrial infrastructure can affect the physical and chemical nature of streams, rivers, and upland habitat and potentially lead to degradation, fragmentation, and loss of spawning, rearing, and migration habitats (Natural Research Council, 1996). salmon and steelhead are sensitive to changes in stream temperature, flow, turbidity, dissolved oxygen levels, and water contamination. As well, salmon and steelhead are dependent on the habitat complexity (for cover and temperature moderation) provided by naturally vegetated banks and, therefore may be affected by degradation or alteration of shorelines and stream banks. For each Region, we compile data on seven categories of proposed (and current) resource development pressures: - Oil and gas pipelines - Mining development - Water licenses - Hydroelectric power tenures - Hydroelectric power lines - Wind power tenures - Timber harvesting land base For additional processing details, see Appendix 9. In some Regions, we are also able to document additional infrastructure; this is detailed in Regions. 4.2.8 Limitations: Habitat pressure indicators &amp; analysis methods While the current suite of indicators has been developed according to Wild Salmon Policy guidelines (Stalberg et al., 2009), they do not reflect all of the pressures on wild salmon and steelhead. Understanding the full range of pressures on salmon and steelhead requires documenting marine habitat pressures, climate change indicators, and a deeper understanding of fisheries pressure, to name a few. Given the set of habitat pressure indicators that we currently include on the Pacific Salmon Explorer, specific limitations of our approach relate to outdated and incomplete datasets, benchmark methodologies, and methods for calculating cumulative pressure scores. These limitations apply to all Regions, species, and CUs that we include in the Pacific Salmon Explorer and should be considered as both caveats to the current habitat assessment results as well as future research priorities. 4.2.8.1 Data Needs Incomplete and outdated datasets are a continued challenge for completing coarse-scale assessments of risks to freshwater habitats. For example, the Total Land Cover Alteration indicator uses land cover classification data between 1996-2005 and the National Topographic system dataset from 1998. This is an example of where more current datasets certainly exist but are either not yet publicly available or may not conform to our data selection criteria. Throughout the Regions in BC, some areas contain privately managed forest land. As such, forest disturbance data sourced from DataBC in these areas is either incomplete or not up to date. We defined a ‘Data Deficient’ status for the forest disturbance indicator to overcome this challenge. The data deficient status was assigned for any watershed that was &gt;= 50% privately owned forest. The exception was that high-risk status was maintained and reported if a watershed was high risk for forest disturbance based on the publicly available forest disturbance data. Overall, temporal and spatial data gaps limit our ability to quantify and assess current freshwater salmon and steelhead habitat risks accurately. Better and more currently maintained spatial data are needed to support a more accurate and up-to-date assessment of pressures on freshwater salmon and steelhead habitats across all Regions (see Appendix 6 for dataset limitations). 4.2.8.2 Refining Benchmarks Additional research is needed to define science-based benchmarks for some pressure indicators. In the interim, we use benchmarks based on relative rankings within each Region ((Table 4.12); see Appendix 12 for specific benchmark values for each Region). While acceptable as an interim approach (Stalberg et al., 2009), this presents data interpretation challenges and limits our ability to compare habitat assessments across Regions for those indicators. Until empirical or science-based benchmarks are available, it is important to consider the relative nature of the habitat assessments for these indicators when interpreting the results. 4.2.8.3 Cumulative Pressure Scores The approach we use to calculate overall cumulative pressure scores for freshwater salmon and steelhead habitats is a roll-up rule set described in Appendix 11. Using this approach means that each indicator is weighted equally in terms of the overall cumulative pressure score. We do not weight certain indicators as having more or less impact on salmon and steelhead habitat over others. Determining how best to aggregate indicators to calculate overall cumulative pressure scores is a challenge, and while this approach is transparent and easily understood by a range of audiences, it is certainly not the only way to aggregate indicators, nor necessarily the best way. 4.3 Reporting Status Across Spatial Scales In addition to providing biological and habitat information for individual salmon and steelhead CUs, we also provide information on the status and trends of salmon and steelhead populations and their habitats at the Stock Management Unit (SMU), regional, and provincial scales to improve understanding of the current state of salmon and steelhead at different geographic scales. While finer-scale data such as CUs are important for supporting the implementation of Canada’s Wild Salmon Policy, coarser-scale synoptic overviews of salmon and steelhead population status and trends across species and regions are also important for salmon and steelhead conservation and management. These multi-scale overviews help to improve understanding of patterns in trends and status of salmon and steelhead CUs across or within regions of BC and offer insights into potential habitat pressures that could be driving changes in salmon and steelhead populations. They can also inform regional, provincial, and federal planning and decision-making. 4.3.1 Stock Management Units In order to increase the utility of the Pacific Salmon Explorer as a reporting tool for DFO and others under the new Fisheries Act, CUs can be grouped and sorted by Stock Management Unit (SMU), based on the provisional list provided by DFO. We are also currently working with DFO to incorporate SMUs into the Pacific Salmon Explorer in additional ways. 4.3.2 Regional Summaries Biological information is summarized at the regional scale to provide a measure of how the total number of returning adult salmon and steelhead has changed over time for each species within each Region on the Pacific Salmon Explorer. We determine (1) the total run size (catch + spawner abundance) for each individual CU and; (2) the total salmon and steelhead run size for all CUs combined within a given species. In the Pacific Salmon Explorer, we display the total run size for each CU within each species in a single Region, along with the same total run size data standardized so that larger CUs do not dominate the summaries. In both cases, we also display the overall trend for each species. Habitat information is also summarized at the regional scale for each Region in the Pacific Salmon Explorer by providing a comparison of the 12 habitat pressure indicators. In the Pacific Salmon Explorer, for each indicator, we display the percentage of FWA watersheds within the combined ZOI for all CUs within a species that are rated low, moderate, and high risk. The indicators are then ranked from high to low relative to the percentage of high-risk FWA watersheds assessed for a given indicator. This summary provides a snapshot of how the pressure indicators rank compared to one another and which pressures included in the Pacific Salmon Explorer pose the greatest risk to freshwater salmon and steelhead habitats within a Region. 4.3.2.1 Provincial Summaries On the Pacific Salmon Explorer, we provide an overview of the status and trends of salmon and steelhead CUs at the BC scale based on two indicators, run size and biological status. Trends in run size provide a measure of how the total number of returning adult salmon and steelhead has changed over time for each species. We display (1) the total run size (catch + spawner abundance) over time by species in each Region, (2) the standardized run size (catch + spawner abundance) over time by species in each Region, and (3) the percent change between the most recent decade relative to the long-term average. We also summarize the current biological status for each salmon and steelhead species across BC and a visual comparison of biological status across regions via maps. This summary provides a snapshot of the current biological status by species by quantifying the proportion of CUs within a species in the green, amber, and red status zones. It also shows where these CUs are located. We do not currently visualize habitat summary statistics at the BC scale. Differences in the way habitat benchmarks are quantified (e.g. relative vs. science-based benchmarks; see Habitat Pressure Indicator Benchmarks present challenges in making provincial comparisons of habitat status. Through future work with the Habitat Science Advisory Committee, we hope to develop BC-scale habitat summaries. "],["regions.html", "Chapter 5 Regions 5.1 Skeena Region 5.2 Nass Region 5.3 Central Coast Region 5.4 Fraser Region 5.5 Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets 5.6 Haida Gwaii Region 5.7 Columbia Region", " Chapter 5 Regions Each Region within the Pacific Salmon Explorer has specific attributes related to management regimes, data collection, documentation protocols, and most importantly, salmon populations and habitats (Figure 5.1). Here, we document Region-specific data sources, methodological considerations, and social processes used in each of the initial biological status, habitat pressure assessments, and any other unique information for each region currently within the Pacific Salmon Explorer. Figure 5.1: Map of the PSE Regions. 5.1 Skeena Region The Skeena River watershed, located along the north coast of BC, is the second-largest in the province, contains important tributaries, including the Babine, Kispiox, and Bulkley Rivers, and is one of the most productive river systems in BC. All five species of Pacific salmon spawn and rear in the lower and upper portions of the Skeena River Basin (Figure 5.2) within 55 CUs: 12 Chinook, 4 coho, 4 chum, 5 pink, 2 river-type sockeye, and 28 lake-type sockeye (Appendix 1). The process of data gathering, synthesis, outreach, and engagement to complete the initial assessments within the Skeena Region was conducted over five years, from 2010 to 2014. Figure 5.2: Map of the Skeena Region. In order to develop the Pacific Salmon Explorer for the Skeena, we formed a Skeena Technical Advisory Committee and engaged with First Nations, DFO, and other salmon experts throughout the watershed. Through the Technical Advisory Committee process, we received input and feedback from the Gitanyow Fisheries Authority, DFO, Office of the Wet’suwet’en, Lake Babine Nation, Gitxsan Watershed Authorities, Gitxaala First Nation, North Coast-Skeena First Nations Stewardship Society, SkeenaWild Conservation Trust, Bulkley Valley Research Centre, Suskwa Research, BC Ministry of Environment, and DFO. Based on feedback from the Skeena Technical Advisory Committee, we made several changes to the CU list in this project. The Mcdonnell, Aldrich, and Dennis lake-type sockeye CUs were combined into a single CU (Mcdonnell/Aldrich/Dennis) since the contribution of each of these lakes cannot be currently assessed from the estimated spawner abundance data. Similarly, the Morice and Atna lake-type sockeye CUs were combined (Morice/Atna), the Swan and Club Lake lake-type sockeye CUs were combined (Swan/Club), and the Bulkley and Maxan (Bulkley/Maxan) lake-type sockeye CUs were combined for the same reason. The Babine lake-type sockeye CU was split into four CUs based on run-timing and enhancement. The wild portions of the CU were split into Babine/Onerka (early timing), Tahlo/Morrison (mid timing), and Nilkitkwa (late timing). The enhanced portion of the CU (originating from the Pinkut and Fulton spawning channels) is considered as the Babine (enhanced) CU. 5.1.1 Biological Data and Analytical Methods On the North and Central Coast, including the Skeena Region, PSF primarily accessed data through the North and Central Coast (NCC) Database (English et al., 2018). The NCC Database is a database produced and maintained by LGL Ltd. (an environmental consulting firm) that synthesizes datasets on spawner surveys, catch, exploitation rate, and age structure. It also includes generated datasets for CU-level estimates of spawner abundance, run size, and exploitation rate from 1954- 2017. For the most part, data in the NCC Database have been sourced by LGL from DFO’s New Salmon Escapement Database (NuSEDS), the Fisheries Operating System (FOS), and other DFO databases. Details regarding nuances to the data and analytical methods specific to the Skeena Region are described below. 5.1.1.1 Spawner Surveys Spawner survey data for streams in the Skeena Region were sourced from DFO’s New Salmon Escapement Database (NuSEDS). For a description of the spawner survey indicator, see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, A: Spawner Surveys. 5.1.1.2 Spawner Abundance Observed spawner abundance for CUs in the Skeena Region is the sum of all spawner survey data documented in NuSEDS, as described in Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, B: Spawner Abundance. The quantity and quality of the estimated spawner abundance in NuSEDS varies by time period, region, and stream. Meanwhile, the observed spawner abundance data are not always representative of actual changes in abundance through time for a CU. As such, an “expansion procedure” is needed so that any changes in abundance through time are not confounded with changes in monitoring effort. Since 2008, PSF has worked with LGL Limited to generate Skeena (and Nass and Central Coast) CU-level estimated spawner abundance or run reconstructions in collaboration with DFO North Coast stock assessment staff (English et al., 2006; English, 2012; English et al., 2018). Three expansion factors are used to generate estimated spawner abundance. The first expansion factor uses historical proportional contribution data to infill indicator streams not monitored in a given year. The second expansion factor expands the data from the monitored indicator streams so that the estimated spawner abundance is representative of the entire CU. The final expansion factor expands this number again for observer efficiency. Skeena CU-level estimates of spawner abundance (run reconstructions) were sourced from the North and Central Coast (NCC) database. The expansion procedures, by necessity, make a number of simplifying assumptions. The first expansion factor assumes that the proportion of the overall CU that each indicator stream represents is constant through time. The second expansion factor assumes that indicator and non-indicator streams make up a constant contribution to the overall abundance of a CU. The final expansion factor assumes that observer efficiency is constant between years, CUs, methodologies (except for fences), and hydrological systems (see Appendix E in English et al., 2016). For CUs in the Skeena Region (and for CUs in the Nass and Central Coast Regions). We attempted to account for potential data quality issues associated with the final observer efficiency expansion factor (see Section 4.1.3: Data Quality). However, these assumptions may potentially still incorporate uncertainty into our assessments of biological status in these Region’s CUs. These uncertainties result from spawner surveys being conducted using various methodologies and/or by different observers throughout time, which is not currently accounted for. For Skeena Chinook, the methods used to derive spawner abundance estimates for Chinook indicator streams (e.g. Kalum, Morice, and Bear) and coverage of Chinook spawning areas improved in the mid-1980s with additional funding provided through the Pacific Salmon Treaty. For most Skeena Chinook indicator streams, there is no basis for defining observer efficiencies before 1985, so these records were not included in the generation of estimated spawner abundance. This means that estimated spawner abundance and catch and run size for Skeena Chinook CUs begin in 1980. In contrast to Chinook, there has been more consistent distribution and quantity of monitoring effort for Skeena sockeye CUs dating back to 1960. For Skeena sockeye CUs, the spawner abundance time series starts in 1960 because this was the first year of pre-1982 run reconstruction analysis (Les Jantz, DFO, pers. comm.). The fact that a large portion of Skeena sockeye have been enumerated at the Babine fence since 1949 provides greater confidence in the annual escapement estimates for sockeye than for Skeena Chinook in the 1960-1984 period. 5.1.1.3 Run Timing Estimates of peak timing of river entry for the different sockeye CUs were estimated from DNA sampled from fish caught in the Tyee test fishery near the mouth of the Skeena River between 2000-2010 (Cox-Rogers, 2012). The duration of the timing of river entry is assumed to have a bell-shaped curve (i.e. normal distribution), so the shape of the curves is defined by the mean and standard deviation of the available run timing data. However, in most instances, there is insufficient data to determine if a different distribution would better describe the shape of the curve. A normal distribution curve is likely a reasonable approximation for run timing in most cases if the run timing is unimodal (i.e. if there is a single peak in run timing). If the run timing is bi-modal (i.e. if there are two run timing groups), the assumption of spread is likely reasonable, but the peak may be misleading. Note that these run timing curves were only used to estimate exploitation rates for Skeena sockeye CUs. A conservative assumption of relatively broad run timing (80-110 days) for each sockeye CU was used so that exploitation rates would not be sensitive to small shifts in fishery timing. For some CUs, run timing information is not available, and for some species, run timing is assumed to be the same for all CUs. Run timing for other species was estimated by DFO North Coast staff. See Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, C: Run Timing for a description of the run timing indicator and methods. 5.1.1.4 Catch &amp; Run Size Catch and run size, and subsequent exploitation rates for CUs in the Skeena region were calculated by LGL and DFO from the Fisheries Operating System (FOS) and other DFO databases. We accessed these datasets via the North and Central Coast (NCC) Database, maintained by LGL Ltd. (English et al., 2018). For a description of catch and run size methods, see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, D: Catch &amp; Run Size. 5.1.1.5 Recruits-per-Spawner Recruits-per-spawner data for CUs in the Skeena Region were derived from the DFO age database and CU-level estimates of spawner abundance and catch and run size, accessed from the NCC Database (English et al., 2018). For a description of recruits-per-spawner methods, see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, E: Recruits-per-Spawner. 5.1.1.6 Trends in Spawner Abundance Trends in spawner abundance for CUs in the Skeena Region were derived from the CU-level estimates of spawner abundance accessed from the NCC Database (English et al., 2018). For a description of trends in spawner abundance methods, see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, F: Trends in Spawner Abundance. 5.1.1.7 Juvenile Surveys Juvenile abundance data for the Babine (enhanced), Babine/Onerka, Tahlo/Morrison, and Nilkitkwa lake-type sockeye CUs were available in Cox-Rogers and Splisted (2012). Juvenile abundance estimates for the Gitanyow lake-type sockeye CU were available from Beblow and Cleveland (2018). Juvenile abundance of the Slamgeesh lake-type sockeye CU was available from Fernando (2012). For a description of the juvenile survey’s indicator, see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, G: Juvenile Surveys. 5.1.1.8 Hatchery Releases Hatchery releases in the Skeena Region for all species were provided by DFO (Joan Bateman, Salmonid Enhancement Program). Refer to Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, H: Hatchery Releases for details on data and analytical methods. 5.1.1.9 Biological Status The biological status assessments for CUs in the Skeena Region reflect data sourced from the NCC database and are current up to 2017. The original approach and results for Skeena biological status assessments are described in Korman and English (2013). As new data become available, we will update the analyses and results in this report and the Pacific Salmon Explorer. See Sections 4.1.4. Benchmarks for Assessing Biological Status and 4.1.5. Decision Rules for Assessing Biological Status for more details on biological status assessment methods. 5.1.2 Habitat Data and Analytical Methods Nuances regarding habitat pressure indicator data and analytical methods for the Skeena Region are listed below. Refer to Section 4.2. Indicators and Benchmarks for Assessing Habitat Status for information on habitat pressure indicators, benchmarks, and the analytical methods used to assess habitat status. Additional details on habitat pressure indicators, data sources, data currency, and benchmarks specific to the Skeena Region are available in Appendix 6 (Description of Habitat Pressure Indicators &amp; Relevance to Salmon), Appendix 7 (Habitat Pressure Datasets &amp; Data Sources), Appendix 8 (Spatial Data Processing for Habitat Pressure Indicators), Appendix 9 (Spatial Data Processing for Future Pressures), Appendix 12 (Habitat Pressure Benchmark Values by Region). 5.1.2.1 Transboundary Conservation Units The pink (even-year) Nass-Skeena Estuary CU spans the boundary between the Skeena and Nass regions. For habitat indicators that used relative benchmarks, habitat status for this transboundary CU was assessed based on benchmarks derived from the Skeena region because a significant portion of this CU’s spawning habitat fell inside the Skeena region. 5.1.2.2 Spawning Zones of Influence Methods for delineating Chinook CU spawning zones of influence (ZOIs) vary by region in accordance with the CU delineation approach used by DFO. In the Skeena, Nass, and Central Coast regions, Chinook CUs are defined using a more restrictive geographic representation, which resulted in fewer (or no) spawning locations occurring within the CU boundaries. As such, spawning ZOIs for each Chinook CU were delineated using the extent of all 1:20K FWA Assessment Watersheds that directly intersected with Skeena Chinook CU boundaries. 5.1.3 Results 5.1.3.1 Biological Status This section provides a high-level overview of the biological status results for all 55 salmon CUs in the Skeena Region. Of the 55 CUs we examined in the Region, we assessed biological status for 31 CUs (56%). The remaining 24 salmon CUs (44%) had insufficient information for evaluating their biological status (see Section 4.1.5. Decision Rules for Assessing Biological Status for the criteria used to define data deficient CUs). Of the CUs for which we were able to assess biological status, 18 (58%) are in the green status zone, 4 (13%) are in the amber zone, and 9 (29%) are in the red status zone. Biological status for all CUs is displayed by species in Figures 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8, and 5.9, below. More information on biological status and benchmarks for each CU is available Table A.6 in Appendix 4. Full results are available online through the Pacific Salmon Explorer, where individual figures, maps, data, and summary statistics are provided for each CU in the Region. The results of these assessments reflect data that are current to 2017. As new data becomes available, we will update the analyses and results in this report and on the Pacific Salmon Explorer.

Figure 5.9: Pacific Salmon Foundation biological status of Skeena sockeye (river-type) salmon Conservation Units. 5.1.3.2 Habitat Status We completed habitat assessments for watersheds within the 55 salmon CUs in the Skeena Region. The habitat assessments produce two levels of outputs for spawning ZOIs: (1) a risk rating for each FWA assessment watershed in the study area for each individual habitat pressure indicator; (2) a cumulative pressure score for each FWA assessment watershed in the study area, representing the risk to a watershed from all habitat pressures combined. Of the 1,183 1:20K FWA assessment watersheds assessed in the Skeena Region, 80% (n= 941) were designated as spawning habitat based on compiled spawning location data. These 941 watersheds represent the combined spawning ZOI for all species. In terms of the cumulative pressure scores for the combined spawning ZOI for all species, 28% of spawning habitat in the Skeena Region is high risk (red), 33% is moderate risk (amber), and 40% is low risk (green). The percentage of spawning habitat in each risk category for each indicator is summarized in (Table 5.1). Quantifying both individual and cumulative pressures at the FWA assessment watershed-scale provides a snapshot of habitat pressures across the Skeena Region and highlights which CUs face the greatest risk. Specifically, an overview of habitat pressures emerges from identifying: the percentage area of the combined spawning ZOI for all species that is rated high, moderate, or low risk (i.e. red, amber, green) for each of the evaluated individual habitat pressure indicators; and the percentage area of the combined spawning ZOI for all species that is rated high, moderate, or low risk (i.e. red, amber, green) for cumulative habitat pressures. More information on habitat pressure benchmark values for each indicator is available in Appendix 12. More information on cumulative spawning Pressure Results by Region and Conservation Unit is available in Appendix 13. Full results are available online through the Pacific Salmon Explorer. The results can be downloaded directly from the Pacific Salmon Explorer for each CU, while the datasets compiled for the analysis are also available for download via the Salmon Data Library. In addition, the Skeena River estuary was assessed in 2015, and results are available on the Pacific Salmon Explorer. For details on the Skeena estuary, habitat assessment methods, see Pickard et al. (2015). % Area of Spawning Habitat Table 5.1: The percentage of area within the Skeena Region’s combined spawning ZOI for all species rated high, moderate, or low risk (i.e. red, amber, green) for cumulative pressures and each of the evaluated individual habitat pressure indicators.

The Nass Region (Figure 5.10), which consists of the watersheds draining into Portland Canal and Observatory Inlet, contains extensive spawning and rearing habitat for all five species of Pacific salmon, as well as steelhead. These salmon populations are managed as 22 CUs under the Wild Salmon Policy: 2-Chinook, 3-chum, 3-coho, 4-pink, and 10-sockeye CUs (Appendix 1). The process of data gathering, synthesis, outreach, and engagement to complete the initial assessments within the Nass Region was conducted over four years, from 2015 to 2019. We worked with First Nations in the Nass Region to garner feedback on the Pacific Salmon Explorer approach and analyses through the Nisga’a-Canada-BC Nass Joint Technical Committee and the Gitanyow Fisheries Authority. In addition, in 2015-2016, we formed a Nass Technical Advisory Committee to engage with First Nations, DFO regional biologists and managers, and other salmon experts throughout the watershed. Figure 5.10: Map of the Nass Region. 5.2.1 Biological Data and Analytical Methods As with the Skeena Region, many of the datasets necessary to understand the dynamics of salmon CUs in the Nass Region have been compiled and stored through the North and Central Coast (NCC) Database (English et al., 2018; see Skeena Region). In addition to these data, we also compiled additional data for six CUs (Lower Nass and Upper Nass coho; Fred Wright, Damodochax, and Meziadin lake-type sockeye; Lower Nass-Portland river-type sockeye) through a review of preliminary data with Nisga’a Lisims Government and LGL Limited staff. Details regarding nuances to the data and analytical methods that are specific to the Nass Region are described below. 5.2.1.1 Spawner Surveys Spawner survey data for streams in the Nass Region were sourced from DFO’s New Salmon Escapement Database (NuSEDS). For a description of the spawner survey indicator, see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, A: Spawner Surveys. 5.2.1.2 Spawner Abundance Observed spawner abundance for CUs in the Nass Region is the sum of all spawner survey data as documented in NuSEDS, as described in Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, B: Spawner Abundance. Nass Region CU-level estimates of spawner abundance (run reconstructions) were sourced from the North and Central Coast (NCC) Database. Nass CU-level estimated spawner abundance time series were developed for the NCC Database according to the expansion factors described in the Skeena Region section above. In addition, CU-level estimates of spawner abundance for five Nass CUs are derived from additional spawner enumeration methods. Specifically, three CUs have mark-recapture programs operated by Nisga’a Fisheries, and Wildlife’s lower Nass River fish wheels have mark-recapture programs. These programs have been part of Nisga’a Treaty fisheries work since 1992. 5.2.1.3 Run Timing We currently do not have CU-level run timing data visualized for any CUs in the Nass Region. See Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, C: Run Timing for a description of the run timing indicator and methods. 5.2.1.4 Catch &amp; Run Size Catch and run size, and subsequent exploitation rates for CUs in the Nass Region were calculated by LGL, Nisga’a Fish and Wildlife, and DFO from the Fisheries Operating System (FOS) and other DFO databases. Similar to our work in the Skeena, we accessed most of these datasets via the North and Central Coast (NCC) Database, maintained by LGL Ltd. (English et al., 2018). For a description of catch and run size methods, see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, D: Catch &amp; Run Size. 5.2.1.5 Recruits-per-Spawner Recruits-per-spawner data for CUs in the Nass Region were derived from the DFO age database and CU-level estimates of spawner abundance and catch and run size accessed from the NCC Database (English et al., 2018). For a description of recruits-per-spawner methods, see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, E: Recruits-per-Spawner. 5.2.1.6 Trends in Spawner Abundance Trends in spawner abundance for CUs on the Central Coast were derived from the CU-level estimates of spawner abundance accessed from the NCC database (English et al., 2018). For a description of trends in spawner abundance methods, see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, F: Trends in Spawner Abundance. 5.2.1.7 Juvenile Surveys *Juvenile survey** data for the Lower Nass coho CU was provided by Nisga’a Fish and Wildlife. For a description of the juvenile survey’s indicator, see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, G: Juvenile Surveys. 5.2.1.8 Hatchery Releases Hatchery releases in the Nass Region for all species were provided by DFO (Joan Bateman, Salmonid Enhancement Program). Refer to Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, H: Hatchery Releases for details on data and analytical methods. 5.2.1.9 Biological Status The biological status assessments for CUs in the Nass Region currently reflect data sourced from the NCC Database that are current to 2017. As new data become available, we will update the analyses and results in this report and the Pacific Salmon Explorer. See Sections 4.1.4. Benchmarks for Assessing Biological Status and 4.1.5. Decision Rules for Assessing Biological Status for more details on biological status assessment methods. 5.2.2 Habitat Data and Analytical Methods Nuances regarding habitat pressure indicator data and analytical methods for the Nass Region are listed below. Refer to Section 4.2 Indicators and Benchmarks for Assessing Habitat Status for information on habitat pressure indicators, benchmarks, and the analytical methods used to assess habitat status. Additional details on habitat pressure indicators, data sources, data currency, and benchmarks specific to the Nass Region are available in Appendix 6 (Description of Habitat Pressure Indicators &amp; Relevance to Salmon), Appendix 7 (Habitat Pressure Datasets &amp; Data Sources), Appendix 8 (Spatial Data Processing for Habitat Pressure Indicators), Appendix 9 (Spatial Data Processing for Future Pressures), and Appendix 12 (Habitat Pressure Benchmark Values by Region). 5.2.2.1 Transboundary Conservation Units The pink (even-year) Nass-Skeena Estuary CU spans the boundary between the Skeena and Nass regions. For habitat indicators that used relative benchmarks, habitat status for this transboundary CU was assessed based on benchmarks derived from the Skeena region because a significant portion of this CU’s spawning habitat fell inside the Skeena region. 5.2.2.2 Spawning Zones of Influence Methods for delineating Chinook CU spawning zones of influence (ZOIs) vary by region in accordance with the CU delineation approach used by DFO. In the Skeena, Nass, and Central Coast regions, Chinook CUs are defined using a more restrictive geographic representation, which resulted in fewer (or no) spawning locations occurring within the CU boundaries. As such, spawning ZOIs for each Chinook CU were delineated using the extent of all 1:20K FWA Assessment Watersheds that directly intersected with Nass Chinook CU boundaries. 5.2.3 Results 5.2.3.1 Biological Status This section provides a high-level overview of the biological status results for all 22 salmon CUs in the Nass Region. Of the 22 CUs examined in the Region, we assessed biological status for 13 CUs (59%). The remaining 9 CUs (41%) had insufficient information for evaluating their biological status (see Section 4.1.5 Decision Rules for Assessing Biological Status for the criteria used to define data deficient CUs). Of the CUs for which we assessed biological status, 10 (77%) are in the green status zone, 3 (23%) are in the amber zone, and none are in the red status zone. Biological status for all CUs is displayed by species in Figures 5.11, 5.12, 5.13, 5.14, 5.15, 5.16, and ??, below. More information on biological status and benchmarks for each CU are available in Table A.7. in Appendix 4. Full results are available online through the Pacific Salmon Explorer, where individual figures, maps, data, and summary statistics are provided for each CU in the Region. The results of these assessments reflect data that are current to 2017. As new data become available, we will update the analyses and results in this report and on the Pacific Salmon Explorer.

The habitat assessments produce two levels of outputs for spawning ZOIs: (1) a risk rating for each FWA assessment watershed in the study area for each individual habitat pressure indicator; (2) a cumulative pressure score for each FWA assessment watershed in the study area, representing the risk to a watershed from all habitat pressures combined. Of the 550 1:20K FWA assessment watersheds assessed in the Nass Region, 42% (n= 229) were designated as spawning habitat based on compiled spawning location data. These 229 watersheds represent the combined spawning ZOI for all species. In terms of the cumulative pressure scores for the combined spawning ZOI for all species, 21% of spawning habitat in the Nass Region is high risk (red), 42% is moderate risk (amber), and 37% is low risk (green). The percentage of spawning habitat in each risk category for each indicator is summarized in (Table 5.2) below. Quantifying both individual and cumulative pressures at the FWA assessment watershed-scale provides a snapshot of habitat pressures across the Nass Region and highlights which CUs face the greatest risk. Specifically, an overview of habitat pressures emerges from identifying: the percentage area of the combined spawning ZOI for all species that is rated high, moderate, or low risk (i.e. red, amber, green) for each of the evaluated individual habitat pressure indicators; and the percentage area of the combined spawning ZOI for all species that is rated high, moderate, or low risk (i.e. red, amber, green) for cumulative habitat pressures. More information on habitat pressure benchmark values for each indicator is available in Appendix 12. More information on cumulative spawning Pressure Results by Region and Conservation Unit is available in Appendix 13. Full results are available online through the Pacific Salmon Explorer.

While this area is less easily defined than an extensive river system such as the Skeena or Fraser Regions, we could determine the Central Coast study area using three criteria. First, the intent was to include the full geographic extent of most CUs on the Central Coast Appendix 1. Second, we considered the adjacency of other Regions within the Pacific Salmon Explorer to minimize overlap between study areas. Third, we considered major drainage patterns as represented in BC’s Freshwater Atlas (FWA) 1:20K Watershed Groups (MOE, 2017a). According to these criteria, the resulting Central Coast Region on the Pacific Salmon Explorer encompasses 54,813 km2 from Smith and Rivers Inlets in the south, and Douglas Channel and Banks, McCauley, and Pitt Islands in the north (Figure 5.17). The process of data gathering, synthesis, outreach, and engagement to complete the initial assessments within the Central Coast Region was conducted over two years, from 2016 to 2018. For the Central Coast Region, we worked with two technical committees (one for the north portion and one for the south portion of the region) to garner feedback on the Pacific Salmon Explorer approach and analyses. These Technical committees were comprised of First Nations, DFO regional biologists, managers, and other salmon experts to garner feedback on the Pacific Salmon Explorer approach and analyses. We received feedback from the Central Coast Indigenous Resource Alliance through a series of North and South Technical Committee Meetings and the Nuxalk, Kitasoo/Xai’Xais, Heiltsuk, Wuikinuxv Gitxaala, and Haisla First Nations. As part of the Technical Committee review process, we removed two CUs from the project (Whalen Lake and Owikeno-Late sockeye (lake-type) CUs). The Whalen Lake sockeye CU is included in Holtby and Ciruna (2007), but long-time Charter Patrolman and Technical Committee member, Stan Hutchings, recommended removing it from the list of CUs. An impassable waterfall prevents sockeye from accessing Whalen Lake, which is the spawning and rearing lake for this CU. As such, we removed this CU from the project. The Owikeno-Late sockeye CU is not listed in Holtby and Ciruna (2007) but was provisionally designated as a CU by Blair Holtby in 2008. However, a Technical Committee member from Wuikinuxv advised us that this CU is not distinguishable from other sockeye CUs in the lake. Furthermore, this CU was not included on the most recent list of CUs published on the Government of Canada’s Open Data portal. Given that it was not in the most current list of CUs, it lacks baseline data, and we could not find any documentation about its creation. Therefore, we removed this CU from the project. Figure 5.17: Map of the Central Coast Region. 5.3.1 Biological Data and Analytical Methods There are several nuances to the data sources and analytical methods specific to the Central Coast Region. These nuances are listed below. 5.3.1.1 Spawner Surveys Spawner survey data for streams in the Central Coast were sourced from DFO’s New Salmon Escapement Database (NuSEDS). For a description of the spawner survey indicator, see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, A: Spawner Surveys. 5.3.1.2 Spawner Abundance Observed spawner abundance for CUs in the Central Coast Region is the sum of all spawner survey data documented in NuSEDS, as described in Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, B: Spawner Abundance. Similar to our work in the Skeena and Nass, we accessed most of these datasets via the North and Central Coast (NCC) database, maintained by LGL Ltd. (English et al., 2018). Central Coast CU-level estimates of spawner abundance (run reconstructions) were sourced from the North and Central Coast (NCC) database. In addition, updated estimated spawner abundance data for the South Atnarko Lakes CU was accessed from DFO (Connors et al., 2016). Central Coast CU-level estimated spawner abundance time series were developed for the NCC database according to the expansion factors described in the Skeena Region section above. 5.3.1.3 Run Timing We currently do not have CU-level run timing data for any CUs in the Central Coast Region. We will update this information as CU-level run timing data become publicly available. See Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, C: Run Timing for a description of the run timing indicator and methods. 5.3.1.4 Catch &amp; Run Size Catch and run size, and subsequent exploitation rates for CUs on the Central Coast were calculated by DFO and LGL from data in the Fisheries Operating System (FOS) and other DFO databases. Similar to our work in the Skeena and Nass, we accessed most of these datasets via the North and Central Coast (NCC) Database, maintained by LGL Ltd. (English et al., 2018). In addition, we sourced updated catch data from DFO for the South Atnarko Lakes CU (Connors et al., 2016). For a description of catch and run size methods, see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, D: Catch &amp; Run Size. 5.3.1.5 Recruits-per-Spawner Recruits-per-spawner data for CUs on the Central Coast were derived from the DFO age database and CU-level estimates of spawner abundance and catch and run size accessed from the NCC Database (English et al., 2018). For a description of recruits-per-spawner methods, see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, E: Recruits-per-Spawner. 5.3.1.6 Trends in Spawner Abundance Trends in spawner abundance for CUs on the Central Coast were derived from the CU-level estimates of spawner abundance accessed from the NCC database (English et al., 2018). For a description of trends in spawner abundance methods, see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, F: Trends in Spawner Abundance. 5.3.1.7 Juvenile Surveys Juvenile survey data for the Hecate Lowlands (even) pink, Hecate Strait-Lowlands (odd) pink, Hecate Strait Mainland coho, Hecate Lowlands chum, Roderick sockeye, and Mary Cove Creek sockeye CUs within Kitasoo/Xai’xais territory were provided by Larry Greba (Kitasoo/Xai’xais Development Corporation). For a description of the juvenile survey’s indicator, see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, G: Juvenile Surveys. 5.3.1.8 Hatchery Releases Hatchery releases in the Central Coast Region for all species were provided by DFO (Joan Bateman, Salmonid Enhancement Program). Refer to Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, H: Hatchery Releases for details on data and analytical methods. 5.3.1.9 Biological Status The biological status assessments for CUs in the Central Coast Region reflect data sourced from the NCC database and are current up to 2017. As new data become available, we will update the analyses and results in this report and the Pacific Salmon Explorer. See Sections 4.1.4. Benchmarks for Assessing Biological Status and 4.1.5. Decision Rules for Assessing Biological Status for more details on biological status assessment methods. 5.3.2 Habitat Data and Analytical Methods Nuances regarding habitat pressure indicator data and analytical methods for the Central Coast Region are listed below. Refer to Section 4.2. Indicators and Benchmarks for Assessing Habitat Status for information on habitat pressure indicators, benchmarks, and the analytical methods used to assess habitat status. Additional details on habitat pressure indicators, data sources, data currency, and benchmarks specific to the Skeena Region are available in Appendix 6 (Description of Habitat Pressure Indicators &amp; Relevance to Salmon), Appendix 7 (Habitat Pressure Datasets &amp; Data Sources), Appendix 8 (Spatial Data Processing for Habitat Pressure Indicators), Appendix 9 (Spatial Data Processing for Future Pressures), Appendix 12 (Habitat Pressure Benchmark Values by Region). 5.3.2.1 Transboundary Conservation Units The pink (odd-year) Homathko-Klinaklini-Smith-Rivers-Bella Coola-Dean Conservation Unit spans the boundary between the Central Coast and Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets regions. For habitat indicators that used relative benchmarks, habitat status for this transboundary conservation unit was assessed based on benchmarks derived from the Central Coast region because a significant portion of spawning habitat for this conservation unit fell inside the Central Coast region. 5.3.2.2 Spawning Zones of Influence Methods for delineating Chinook CU spawning zones of influence (ZOIs) vary by region in accordance with the CU delineation approach used by DFO. In the Skeena, Nass, and Central Coast regions, Chinook CUs are defined using a more restrictive geographic representation, which resulted in fewer (or no) spawning locations occurring within the CU boundaries. As such, spawning ZOIs for each Chinook CU were delineated using the extent of all 1:20K FWA Assessment Watersheds that directly intersected with Central Chinook CU boundaries. 5.3.2.3 Additional Spawning Habitat Information Sources In addition to the spawning habitat information we acquired from the Fisheries Information Summary System (FISS) database and local knowledge derived through expert elicitation, we received additional spawning habitat information from a technical report provided by Diana Chan and Mike Reid (Fisheries, Heiltsuk First Nation; Temple, 2007). 5.3.3 Results 5.3.3.1 Biological Status This section provides a high-level overview of the biological status results for all 114 salmon CUs in the Central Coast Region. Of the 114 CUs we examined in the Region, we assessed biological status for 49 CUs (43%). The remaining 65 salmon CUs (57%) had insufficient information for evaluating their biological status (see Section 4.1.5. Decision Rules for Assessing Biological Status for the criteria used to define data deficient CUs). Of the CUs for which we were able to assess biological status, 18 (58%) are in the green status zone, 4 (13%) are in the amber zone, and 9 (29%) are in the red status zone. Biological status for all CUs is displayed by species in Figures 5.18, 5.19, 5.20, 5.21, 5.22, 5.23, and 5.24, below. More information on biological status and benchmarks for each CU is available Table A.6 in Appendix 4. Full results are available online through the Pacific Salmon Explorer, where individual figures, maps, data, and summary statistics are provided for each CU in the Region. The results of these assessments reflect data that are current to 2017. As new data becomes available, we will update the analyses and results in this report and on the Pacific Salmon Explorer.

Figure 5.24: Pacific Salmon Foundation biological status of Central Coast sockeye (river-type) salmon Conservation Units. 5.3.3.2 Habitat Status We completed habitat assessments for watersheds within the 114 salmon CUs in the Central Coast Region. The habitat assessments produce two levels of outputs for spawning ZOIs: (1) a risk rating for each FWA assessment watershed in the study area for each individual habitat pressure indicator; (2) a cumulative pressure score for each FWA assessment watershed in the study area, representing the risk to a watershed from all habitat pressures combined. Of the 1,132 1:20K, FWA assessment watersheds assessed in the Central Coast Region, 63% (n=709) were designated as spawning habitat based on compiled spawning location data. These 709 watersheds represent the combined spawning ZOI for all species. In terms of the cumulative pressure scores for the combined spawning ZOI for all species, 9% of spawning habitat in the Central Coast Region is high risk (red), 28% is moderate risk (amber), and 62% is low risk (green). The percentage of spawning habitat in each risk category for each indicator is summarized in (Table 5.3). Quantifying both individual and cumulative pressures at the FWA assessment watershed-scale provides a snapshot of habitat pressures across the entire Central Coast and highlights which CUs face the greatest risk. Specifically, an overview of habitat pressures emerges from identifying: the percentage area of the combined spawning ZOI for all species that is rated high, moderate, or low risk (i.e. red, amber, green) for each of the evaluated individual habitat pressure indicators; and the percentage area of the combined spawning ZOI for all species that is rated high, moderate, or low risk (i.e. red, amber, green) for cumulative habitat pressures; More information on habitat pressure benchmark values for each indicator is available in Appendix 12. More information on cumulative spawning Pressure Results by Region and Conservation Unit is available in Appendix 13. Full results are available online through the Pacific Salmon Explorer. The results can be downloaded directly from the Pacific Salmon Explorer for each CU, while the datasets compiled for the analysis are also available for download via the Salmon Data Library. % Area of Spawning Habitat Table 5.3: The percentage of area within the Central Coast Region’s combined spawning ZOI for all species rated high, moderate, or low risk (i.e. red, amber, green) for cumulative pressures and each of the evaluated individual habitat pressure indicators.

There are 8 CUs in the Fraser Region designated as extinct by DFO, two of which have been reintroduced and are new de novo CUs Appendix 1. DFO officially uses the European designation to indicate age class for CUs within the Fraser Region. However, in the Pacific Salmon Explorer and this report, we use the Gilbert-Rich designation, which is more familiar to most users. We made this decision based on feedback from the Population Science Advisory Committee and other local users in the Region. The process of data gathering, synthesis, outreach, and engagement to complete the initial assessments within the Fraser Region was conducted over two years, from the spring of 2018 to 2020. Figure 5.25: Map of the Fraser Region. Within the Fraser Region, we worked with First Nations, DFO regional biologists and managers, and other salmon experts to garner feedback on the Pacific Salmon Explorer approach and analyses through four sub-regions according to geographic and social groupings: Lower Fraser, Middle Fraser - Mainstem, Middle Fraser - Thompson, and Upper Fraser. Through a series of introductory and Technical Meetings, we received feedback from First Nation aggregate organizations and individual First Nations across those areas, including the Lower Fraser Fisheries Alliance (LFFA) and Lower Fraser First Nations, Secwepemc Fisheries Commission (SFC), and SFC First Nations, Scw’exmx Tribal Council (STC), St’at’imc Chiefs Council (SCC) and member Nations, Nlaka’pamux Nation Tribal Council (NNTC) and NNTC First Nations, Okanagan Nation Alliance (ONA), and the Upper Fraser Fisheries Conservation Alliance including members of the Tsilhqot’in National Government, Carrier-Sekani Tribal Council (CSTC), North Shuswap Tribal Council (NSTC), and Carrier-Chilcotin Tribal Council (CCTC). 5.4.1 Biological Data and Analytical Methods In the Fraser Region, we accessed datasets for biological status and indicators directly from DFO staff. Additional data was sourced from NuSEDS, FOS, and the Pacific Salmon Commission. Details on specific data sources and analytical methods for the Fraser Region are described below. 5.4.1.1 Spawner Surveys Spawner survey data for streams in the Fraser Region were sourced from DFO’s New Salmon Escapement Database (NuSEDS). For a description of the spawner survey indicator, see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, A: Spawner Surveys. 5.4.1.2 Spawner Abundance In the Fraser Region, observed spawner abundance is the sum of all spawner survey data documented in NuSEDS, as described in Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, B: Spawner Abundance. Estimated spawner abundance in Fraser Region is not available from a centralized database as it is in the North and Central Coast through the NCC Database (English et al., 2018). Estimates of spawner abundance were acquired from specific DFO biologists with the following species-specific nuances. For sockeye, we visualize Effective Total Spawners, which reflects an estimate provided by DFO of successfully spawned female and male sockeye, accounting for pre-spawn mortality (during migration; provided by Tracy Cone, DFO Stock Assessment, Sockeye &amp; Pink Analytical Program). For pink salmon, we visualize a dataset acquired from the Pacific Salmon Commission (Fiona Martens, Pacific Salmon Commission). This dataset has some uncertainty as the enumeration program for pink salmon escapement in the Fraser River has varied over time. Specifically, DFO stopped conducting spawner survey programs for pink salmon in 2001; therefore, estimates from 2003-2007 are based on test fishing programs in the marine approach area before river entry and within the lower Fraser River. Estimates from 2009 onward are based on the hydroacoustics program run by the Pacific Salmon Commission at Mission. For Chinook, estimated spawner abundance was generated through the Southern BC Chinook Technical Working Group (Brown et al., 2020). In contrast to estimated spawner abundance values for other species and areas, values for Fraser Chinook are only a subset of those available for the entire CU. These values are based on the most intensively monitored streams (i.e. there is no expansion made so that the estimated value represents CU as the whole). The year at which each estimate spawner abundance time series for Chinook also varies based on the availability and quality of data, with the start year of the time series determined by expert opinion (Brown et al., 2020). For coho, estimated spawner abundance was sourced from Korman et al. (2019). There are no CU-level estimates of spawner abundance for chum salmon in the Fraser River. Thus, biological status of chum are data deficient for this Region. 5.4.1.3 Run Timing Run timing estimates were provided for all 25 Fraser sockeye CUs (Fiona Martens, Pacific Salmon Commission). The median estimate date and spread represent the run timing date through DFO Area 20 for each management unit from 1980 to 2017. Each CU within a management unit was assumed to have the same run timing. See Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, C: Run Timing for a description of the run timing indicator and methods. 5.4.1.4 Catch &amp; Run Size Catch and run size data were provided for pink and sockeye (Fiona Martens, Pacific Salmon Commission) in the Fraser Region. For pink, catch data was separated between US and Canadian fisheries from 2011-2021. Prior to 2011, we show the combined US and Canadian catch data. For Fraser sockeye catch and run size data, we worked with the Pacific Salmon Commission to institute a number of region-specific visualization exceptions. Specifically, we have introduced two Fraser sockeye-specific parameters: Run Size Adjustment (RSA) and In Season Run Size. For Fraser sockeye CUs, RSA accounts for in-river mortality, and/or positive or negative adjustment to available spawner and catch estimates; it is based on a post-season evaluation of risk factors influencing the probability of successful migration and an evaluation of biases for estimates of spawning escapements and catch (and other ‘miscellaneous’ biases). The RSA data begins in 2003 (see further details below). Prior to 2009, the RSA estimates have been based on differences between estimates (DBEs), i.e. differences between the number of salmon observed at Mission minus upstream catches and the spawning ground estimates. The process to determine the RSA is expert-led and conducted annually in the post-season to evaluate estimates of en-route mortality and to estimate biases in spawning escapement and catch. The RSA process requires various assessments and detailed discussions among participants. While efforts are being made to execute this process more promptly, the RSA process will delay the availability of run size estimates by at least one or potentially more years. In addition to the RSA process, there may be other reasons why the derivation of run size estimates for Fraser River sockeye salmon are delayed e.g. delay in receiving catch reports. The in-season run size is a preliminary estimate based on in-season data until post-season spawner, catch, and run size adjustment estimates are available. These preliminary estimates of run size are based on hydroacoustic estimates of fish passage collected at Mission plus seaward catches. For Fraser River sockeye, exploitation rates are also provided by Management Group, as CU-specific exploitation rates are not considered reliable, especially when abundances are low. For a general description of catch and run size methods, see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, D: Catch &amp; Run Size. 5.4.1.5 Recruits-per-Spawner Recruits-per-spawner data were derived by DFO and provided for pink (Fiona Martens, Pacific Salmon Commission) and sockeye (Tracy Cone, DFO Stock Assessment, Sockeye &amp; Pink Analytical Program) in the Fraser Region. For a description of recruits-per-spawner methods, see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, E: Recruits-per-Spawner. 5.4.1.6 Trends in Spawner Abundance Trends in spawner abundance were derived for pink, Chinook, and sockeye from the estimated spawner abundance data provided by the Pacific Salmon Commission (Fiona Martens), Brown et al. (2020), and DFO (Tracy Cone, DFO Stock Assessment, Sockeye &amp; Pink Analytical Program) respectively. For a description of trends in spawner abundance methods, see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, F: Trends in Spawner Abundance. 5.4.1.7 Juvenile Surveys In the Fraser Region, we accessed juvenile survey data for two sockeye CUs: Cultus Lake (provided by Mike Bradford, DFO Ecosystem Sciences Division, Freshwater Ecosystems) and Chilko-Summer (provided by Mike Hawkshaw, DFO Stock Assessment, Sockeye &amp; Pink Analytical Program). juvenile abundance data are collected at Cultus Lake, within the Lower Fraser River, at a counting fence on Sweltzer Creek, the downstream outlet of the lake. DFO has been monitoring juvenile outmigration at Sweltzer Creek since 1926. Similarly, juvenile abundance at Chilko Lake has also been monitored by DFO in collaboration with local First Nations fisheries technicians at a juvenile counting fence each spring since 1949. For a description of the juvenile survey indicator, see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, G: Juvenile Surveys. 5.4.1.8 Hatchery Releases Hatchery releases in the Fraser Region for all species were provided by DFO (Joan Bateman, Salmonid Enhancement Program). Refer to Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, H: Hatchery Releases for details on data and analytical methods. 5.4.1.9 Biological Status Nuances regarding biological status assessments for Fraser CUs are listed below. See Sections 4.1.4. Benchmarks for Assessing Biological Status and 4.1.5. Decision Rules for Assessing Biological Status for more details on biological status assessment methods. 5.4.1.9.1 Southern BC Chinook CUs For 19 Southern BC Chinook CUs in the Fraser Region, we only visualize biological status assessed in the most recent Wild Salmon Policy report (DFO, 2018) and status assessments completed by COSEWIC (COSEWIC, 2018) for several reasons. First, there are no CU-level spawner-recruitment data available for these CUs. Thus, we cannot apply our spawner-recruitment benchmarks to assess status (see Section 4.1.5. Decision Rules for Assessing Biological Status). In addition, these CUs likely exhibit low productivity (&lt;1.5%) and a relatively high exploitation rate (&gt;40%). As a result, it is inappropriate to use our percentile benchmarks because it has been shown to result in status assessments that are not precautionary (Holt et al., 2018). The WSP and COSEWIC approaches apply these CUs because they apply multiple metrics and expert judgment to assess status. 5.4.1.10 Fraser sockeye with cyclic dominance For some sockeye CUs, annual cycle lines over time fluctuate in abundance by many orders of magnitude in relatively predictable patterns over a 4-year cycle. These patterns termed “cyclic dominance,” are characterized by one dominant cycle line that is very abundant, one that is sub-dominant and of moderate abundance, and two that have very low abundance. Delayed density-dependent mortality (i.e. interactions between cycle lines, which cause the survival of year-classes that follow the most abundant year to be reduced) is believed to be an important contributing factor to these large variations in abundance among brood lines. However, the exact operating mechanism remains unclear. For some CUs, brood line dominance has shifted over time, i.e. the same brood year is not consistently the dominant brood line over the entire modern time series. While cyclic dominance may be a factor in many sockeye CUs, it has only been explicitly documented for six sockeye CUs within the Fraser Region. Consequently, this phenomenon is only a consideration for our work on the Pacific Salmon Explorer for the Fraser Region. For these six cyclic CUs, we only visualize biological status as assessed by DFO and reported in the most recent Wild Salmon Policy report (DFO, 2018; see Section 4.1.5. Decision Rules for Assessing Biological Status). The reason for this is due to the complexity of their life history and the resulting challenges with applying our standardized approach to assessing biological status using either spawner-recruitment or percentile benchmarks. The WSP and COSEWIC approaches apply these CUs because they apply multiple metrics and expert judgment to assess status. 5.4.2 Habitat Data and Analytical Methods Nuances regarding habitat pressure indicator data and analytical methods for the Fraser Region are listed below. Refer to Section 4.2 Indicators and Benchmarks for Assessing Habitat Status for information on habitat pressure indicators, benchmarks, and the analytical methods used to assess habitat status. Additional details on habitat pressure indicators, data sources, data currency, and benchmarks specific to the Fraser Region are available in Appendix 6 (Description of Habitat Pressure Indicators &amp; Relevance to Salmon), Appendix 7 (Habitat Pressure Datasets &amp; Data Sources), Appendix 8 (Spatial Data Processing for Habitat Pressure Indicators), Appendix 9 (Spatial Data Processing for Future Pressures), and Appendix 12 (Habitat Pressure Benchmark Values by Region). 5.4.2.1 Spawning Zones of Influence Methods for delineating Chinook CU spawning zones of influence (ZOIs) vary by region in accordance with the CU delineation approach used by DFO. In the Fraser and Vancouver Island and Mainland Inlet regions, Chinook CUs are geographically more broadly defined, which means that the methods employed for determining pink, chum, and coho spawning ZOIs were also applicable to Chinook CUs. The localized spawning ZOI for each Fraser Chinook CU was delineated by capturing the extent of all 1:20K FWA assessment watersheds that directly intersect with known spawning locations for Chinook. 5.4.3 Results 5.4.3.1 Biological Status This section provides a high-level overview of the biological status results for all 62 salmon CUs in the Fraser Region. Of the 62 CUs we examined in the Region, we assessed biological status for 17 CUs (33%). Of the remaining 45 salmon CUs, eight were extinct (16%), and 37 (51%) had insufficient information for evaluating their biological status (see Section 4.1.5 Decision Rules for Assessing Biological Status for the criteria used to define data deficient CUs). Of the CUs for which we assessed biological status, 10 (77%) are in the green status zone, 3 (23%) are in the amber zone, and none are in the red status zone. Biological status for all CUs is displayed by species in Figures 5.26, 5.27, ??, 5.29, 5.30, 5.31, 5.32, and ??, below. More information on biological status and benchmarks for each CU are available in Table A.7. in Appendix 4. Full results are available online through the Pacific Salmon Explorer, where individual figures, maps, data, and summary statistics are provided for each CU in the Region. The results of these assessments reflect data that are current to 2021. As new data become available, we will update the analyses and results in this report and on the Pacific Salmon Explorer.

Figure 5.32: Pacific Salmon Foundation biological status of Fraser sockeye (river-type) salmon Conservation Units. 5.4.3.2 Habitat Status We completed habitat assessments for watersheds within the 54 salmon CUs in the Fraser Region. The habitat assessments produce two levels of outputs for spawning ZOIs: (1) a risk rating for each FWA assessment watershed in the study area for each individual habitat pressure indicator; (2) a cumulative pressure score for each FWA assessment watershed in the study area, representing the risk to a watershed from all habitat pressures combined. Of the 4,819 1:20K FWA assessment watersheds assessed in the Fraser Region, 45% (n= 2,184) were designated as spawning habitat based on compiled spawning location data. These 2,184 watersheds represent the combined spawning ZOI for all species. In terms of the cumulative pressure scores for the combined spawning ZOI for all species, 42% of spawning habitat in the Fraser Region is high risk (red), 30% is moderate risk (amber), and 28% is low risk (green). The percentage of spawning habitat in each risk category for each indicator is summarized in (Table 5.4). Quantifying both individual and cumulative pressures at the FWA assessment watershed-scale provides a snapshot of habitat pressures across the Fraser Region and highlights which CUs face the greatest risk. Specifically, an overview of habitat pressures emerges from identifying: 1. the percentage area of the combined spawning ZOI for all species that is rated high, moderate, or low risk (i.e. red, amber, green) for each of the evaluated individual habitat pressure indicators; and 2. the percentage area of the combined spawning ZOI for all species that is rated high, moderate, or low risk (i.e. red, amber, green) for cumulative habitat pressures; More information on habitat pressure benchmark values for each indicator is available in Appendix 12. More information on cumulative spawning Pressure Results by Region and Conservation Unit is available in Appendix 13. Full results are available online through the Pacific Salmon Explorer.

We defined the Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets Region according to similar criteria used on the Central Coast: geographic proximity to other Regions within the Pacific Salmon Explorer, geographic extent of CUs mainly contained within the Region and FWA Watershed Groups. The resulting Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets Region (Figure 5.33) encompasses 76,411 km2 across Vancouver Island and the adjacent mainland fjords and inlets, from Burrard Inlet and Howe Sound in the south to Smith Inlet and the northern Broughton Archipelago in the north. The process of data gathering, synthesis, outreach, and engagement to complete the initial assessments within the Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets Region was conducted over two years, from the spring of 2018 to 2020. For the Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlet Region, we engaged with First Nations, DFO regional biologists and managers, and other salmon experts who provided feedback on the development of the Pacific Salmon Explorer through several localized Technical Meetings. The make-up of stakeholders at these Technical Meetings was based on various geographic and social groupings present across the region. Through the Technical Meeting and engagement process, we received feedback from First Nation aggregate organizations and individual First Nations across the Region, including the Island Marine Aquatic Working Group (IMAWG), A-Tlegay Fisheries Society and member Nations, Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, and Nuu-chah-nulth First Nations, Maa-nulth Treaty Society and member Nations, Q’ul-lhanumutsun Aquatic Resources Society and Cowichan Tribes First Nation, Broughton Aquaculture Transition Initiative and the Namgis First Nation, Musgamagw Dzawada’enuxw Fisheries Group, the Quatsino First Nation, and Kwakiutl First Nation. The Sakinaw sockeye CU was declared extinct in the wild by DFO as of 2009 (DFO, 2018). However, there is still a population from a captive broodstock program maintaining a hatchery-derived population in Sakinaw Lake. However, since this CU was immediately reintroduced from broodstock from the same CU, it does not meet the criteria for being declared de novo (Wade et al., 2019). Figure 5.33: Map of the Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets Region. 5.5.1 Biological Data and Analytical Methods In the Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets Region, we directly accessed datasets for biological indicators from DFO staff. Additional data was sourced from NuSEDS and FOS. Details on specific data sources and analytical methods for the Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets Region are described below. 5.5.1.1 Spawner Surveys Spawner survey data for streams in the Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets Region Region were sourced from DFO’s New Salmon Escapement Database (NuSEDS). For a description of the spawner survey indicator, see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, A: Spawner Surveys. 5.5.1.2 Spawner Abundance In the Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets Region, observed spawner abundance is the sum of all spawner survey data documented in NuSEDS, as described in Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, B: Spawner Abundance. Estimated spawner abundance in the Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets Region is not available from a centralized database. Thus, estimates of spawner abundance were acquired from specific DFO biologists. For sockeye, estimated spawner abundance for Sproat and Great Central CUs was provided by Diana Dobson (DFO Stock Assessment). The Nimpkish CU was provided by Pieter van Will (DFO Stock Assessment), and the remaining CUs with estimated spawner abundance time series were sourced directly from NuSEDS. For pink salmon, we visualize a dataset acquired from DFO (Pieter van Will). For Chinook, estimated spawner abundance was generated through the Southern BC Chinook Working Group (Brown et al., 2020). In contrast to estimated spawner abundance values for other species and areas, Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets Chinook values are only a subset of the entire CU. These subset values are based on the most intensively monitored streams (i.e. there is no expansion made so that the estimated value represents the whole CU). The year at which each estimate spawner abundance time series for Chinook also varies based on the availability and quality of data, with the start year of the time series determined by expert opinion (Brown et al., 2020). For chum, estimated spawner abundance was provided by Diana Dobson (DFO Stock Assessment) based on Holt et al.’s (2018) data. There are no CU-level estimates of spawner abundance for coho salmon in the Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets Region. Thus, biological status for coho is data deficient for this Region. 5.5.1.3 Run Timing We currently do not have CU-level run timing data for any CUs in the Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets Region. We will update this information as CU-level run timing data become publicly available. See Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, C: Run Timing for a description of the run timing indicator and methods. 5.5.1.4 Catch &amp; Run Size Catch and run size data were provided for chum (Diana Dobson, DFO Stock Assessment), pink (Pieter van Will, DFO Stock Assessment), and sockeye (Diana Dobson and Pieter van Will, DFO Stock Assessment) in the Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets Region. For a general description of catch and run size methods, see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, D: Catch &amp; Run Size. 5.5.1.5 Recruits-per-Spawner Recruits-per-spawner data were derived by DFO and provided for chum (Diana Dobson, DFO Stock Assessment), pink (Pieter van Will, DFO Stock Assessment), Chinook (Mary Thiess (DFO Stock Assessment), and sockeye (Diana Dobson and Pieter van Will, DFO Stock Assessment) in the Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets Region. see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, E: Recruits-per-Spawner. 5.5.1.6 Trends in Spawner Abundance Trends in spawner abundance were derived for chum (Diana Dobson, DFO Stock Assessment), pink (Pieter van Will, DFO Stock Assessment), and sockeye (Diana Dobson and Pieter van Will, DFO Stock Assessment) in the Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets Region. For a description of trends in spawner abundance methods, see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, F: Trends in Spawner Abundance. 5.5.1.7 Juvenile Surveys We acquired multiple sources’ juvenile survey data for several CUs in the Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets Region. Juvenile survey data for streams within the East Vancouver Island-Georgia Strait coho CU were provided by Jim Meldrum (A-Tlegay Fisheries Society) and Karalea Cantera (DFO, Fish and Fish Habitat Protection Program). Juvenile survey data for streams within the Georgia Strait chum, East Vancouver Island-North (Fall 0.x), Chinook, and Georgia Strait pink (odd) CUs were provided by Jim Meldrum (A-Tlegay Fisheries Society). Juvenile survey data for streams within the West Vancouver Island-South (Fall 0.x) Chinook CU were provided by Bob Bocking (Maa-nulth Treaty Society) and Jared Dick (Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council). Juvenile survey data for streams within the West Vancouver Island coho CU were provided by Roger Dunlop (Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council), Karalea Cantera (DFO, Fish and Fish Habitat Protection Program), and sourced from Wade and Irvine (2018; DFO). Juvenile survey data for the Great Central Lake sockeye, Sproat Lake sockeye), and Henderson Lake sockeye CUs were provided by Graham Murrell (Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council). Juvenile survey data for the Nahwitti Lowland coho CU were provided by Trevor Davies (Provincial Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations &amp; Rural Development) and sourced from Wade and Irvine (2018; DFO). Juvenile survey data for streams within the East Vancouver Island-Georgia Strait coho and Georgia Strait Mainland coho CUs were provided by Karalea Cantera (DFO, Fish and Fish Habitat Protection Program) and sourced from Wade and Irvine (2018; DFO). Juvenile survey data for the Sakinaw Lake sockeye CU were provided by Karalea Cantera (DFO, Fish and Fish Habitat Protection Program). Juvenile surveye data for streams within the Juan de Fuca-Pachena coho CU were sourced from Wade and Irvine (2018; DFO). For a description of the juvenile survey indicator, see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, G: Juvenile Surveys. 5.5.1.8 Hatchery Releases Hatchery releases in the Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets Region for all species were provided by DFO (Joan Bateman, Salmonid Enhancement Program). Refer to Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, H: Hatchery Releases for details on data and analytical methods. 5.5.1.9 Biological Status Nuances regarding biological status assessments forVancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets CUs are listed below. See Sections 4.1.4. Benchmarks for Assessing Biological Status and 4.1.5. Decision Rules for Assessing Biological Status for more details on biological status assessment methods. 5.5.1.9.1 Southern BC Chinook CUs For 14 Southern BC Chinook CUs in the Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets Region, we only visualize biological status as assessed in the most recent Wild Salmon Policy report (DFO, 2018) and COSEWIC status assessments (COSEWIC, 2018) for several reasons (Brown et al., 2020). First, there are no CU-level spawner-recruitment data available for these CUs. Thus, we cannot apply our spawner-recruitment benchmarks to assess status (see Section 4.1.5. Decision Rules for Assessing Biological Status). In addition, these CUs exhibit low productivity (&lt;1.5%) and a relatively high exploitation rate (&gt;40%). As a result, it is inappropriate to our percentile benchmarks because it has been shown to potentially result in status assessments that are not precautionary (Holt et al., 2018). Therefore, the WSP and COSEWIC approaches apply to these CUs because they apply multiple metrics and expert judgment to assess status. 5.5.2 Habitat Data and Analytical Methods Nuances regarding habitat pressure indicator data and analytical methods for the Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets Region are listed below. Refer to Section 4.2 Indicators and Benchmarks for Assessing Habitat Status for information on habitat pressure indicators, benchmarks, and the analytical methods used to assess habitat status. Additional details on habitat pressure indicators, data sources, data currency, and benchmarks specific to the Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlet Region are available in Appendix 6 (Description of Habitat Pressure Indicators &amp; Relevance to Salmon), Appendix 7 (Habitat Pressure Datasets &amp; Data Sources), Appendix 8 (Spatial Data Processing for Habitat Pressure Indicators), Appendix 9 (Spatial Data Processing for Future Pressures), and Appendix 12 (Habitat Pressure Benchmark Values by Region). 5.5.2.1 Transboundary Conservation Units The pink (odd-year) Homathko-Klinaklini-Smith-Rivers-Bella Coola-Dean CU spans the boundary between the Central Coast and Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets regions. For habitat indicators that used relative benchmarks, habitat status for this transboundary conservation unit was assessed based on benchmarks derived from the Central Coast region because a significant portion of spawning habitat for this conservation unit fell inside the Central Coast region. 5.5.2.2 Spawning Zones of Influence Methods for delineating Chinook CU spawning zones of influence (ZOIs) vary by region in accordance with the CU delineation approach used by DFO. In the Fraser and Vancouver Island and Mainland Inlet regions, Chinook CUs are more broadly defined geographically, which meant that the methods employed for determining pink, chum, and coho spawning ZOIs were also applicable to Chinook CUs. The localized spawning ZOI for each VIMI Chinook CU was delineated by capturing the extent of all 1:20K FWA assessment watersheds that directly intersect with known spawning locations for Chinook. 5.5.2.3 Forest Disturbance on Southeast Vancouver Island A large portion of southeast Vancouver Island is privately managed forests. As such, forest disturbance data sourced from DataBC in this area is either incomplete or not up to date. Efforts were made to source the best available data on forest disturbance for these privately managed forests, but we could not access this data. We defined a “Data Deficient” status for the forest disturbance indicator to overcome this challenge. The data deficient status was assigned for any watershed that was &gt;= 50% privately owned forest. The exception was that if a watershed was high risk for forest disturbance based on the publicly available forest disturbance data, then that high-risk status was maintained and reported. 5.5.2.4 Additional Spawning Habitat Information Sources In addition to the spawning habitat information we acquired from the Fisheries Information Summary System (FISS) database and local knowledge derived through expert elicitation, we received additional spawning habitat information from a technical report provided by Graham Murrell (Fisheries Manager, Hupacasath First Nation; Wright, 2008). 5.5.3 Results 5.5.3.1 Biological Status This section provides a high-level overview of the biological status results for all 86 salmon CUs in the Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlet Region. Of the 86 CUs we examined in the Region, we were able to assess biological status for 18 CUs (21%). The remaining 68 salmon CUs (79%) had insufficient information for evaluating their biological status (see Section 4.1.5 Decision Rules for Assessing Biological Status for the criteria used to define data deficient CUs). Of the CUs for which we were able to assess biological status, 12 (67%) of CUs are in the green status zone, 3 (17%) are in the amber zone, and 3 (17%) are in the red status zone. Biological status for all CUs is displayed by species in Figures 5.34, 5.35, ??, 5.37, 5.38, 5.39, 5.40, and ??, below. More information on biological status and benchmarks for each CU are available in Table A.7. in Appendix 4. Full results are available online through the Pacific Salmon Explorer, where individual figures, maps, data, and summary statistics are provided for each CU in the Region. The results of these assessments reflect data that are current to 2018. As new data become available, we will update the analyses and results in this report and on the Pacific Salmon Explorer.

Figure 5.40: Pacific Salmon Foundation biological status of Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets sockeye (river-type) salmon Conservation Units. 5.5.3.2 Habitat Status We completed habitat assessments for watersheds within the 87 salmon CUs in the Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets Region. The habitat assessments produce two levels of outputs for spawning ZOIs: (1) a risk rating for each FWA assessment watershed in the study area for each individual habitat pressure indicator; (2) a cumulative pressure score for each FWA assessment watershed in the study area, representing the risk to a watershed from all habitat pressures combined. Of the 1,539 1:20K, FWA assessment watersheds assessed in the Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets Region, 56% (n= 864) were designated spawning habitat based on compiled spawning location data. These 864 watersheds represent the combined spawning ZOI for all species. In terms of the cumulative pressure scores for the combined spawning ZOI for all species, 42% of spawning habitat in the Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets Region is high risk (red), 36% is moderate risk (amber), and 22% is low risk (green). The percentage of spawning habitat in each risk category for each indicator is summarized in (Table 5.5) below. Quantifying both individual and cumulative pressures at the FWA assessment watershed-scale provides a snapshot of habitat pressures across the Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets Re and highlights which CUs face the greatest risk. Specifically, an overview of habitat pressures emerges from identifying: the percentage area of the combined spawning ZOI for all species that is rated high, moderate, or low risk (i.e. red, amber, green) for each of the evaluated individual habitat pressure indicators; and the percentage area of the combined spawning ZOI for all species that is rated high, moderate, or low risk (i.e. red, amber, green) for cumulative habitat pressures; More information on habitat pressure benchmark values for each indicator is available in Appendix 12. More information on cumulative spawning Pressure Results by Region and Conservation Unit is available in Appendix 13. Full results are available online through the Pacific Salmon Explorer. The results can be downloaded directly from the Pacific Salmon Explorer for each CU. The datasets compiled for the analysis are also available for download via the Salmon Data Library. % Area of Spawning Habitat Table 5.5: The percentage of area within the Vancouver Island &amp; Mainland Inlets Region’s combined spawning ZOI for all species rated high, moderate, or low risk (i.e. red, amber, green) for cumulative pressures and each of the evaluated individual habitat pressure indicators.

The Hecate Strait separates Haida Gwaii from mainland British Columbia by about 100 kilometers. Salmon-bearing waters on Haida Gwaii range from an abundance of small streams along the many kilometers of coastline to larger well-known salmon rivers such as the Yakoun and Tlell Rivers. All five species of Pacific salmon spawn and rear on Haida Gwaii within 29 salmon CUs. These CUs include: 2 Chinook, 5 chum, 3 coho, 3 pink (even-year), 3 pink (odd-year), 10 sockeye (lake-type), and 3 sockeye (river-type). The process of data gathering and synthesis to complete the initial assessments within the Haida Gwaii Region was completed over one year (2021). In order to develop the Pacific Salmon Explorer for Haida Gwaii, we engaged with the Haida Nation, DFO, the Gowgaia Institute, Parks Canada, and other salmon experts in Haida Gwaii. We received input and feedback throughout the engagement processes, which included an in-person meeting in September 2021, meeting follow-up, and extended outreach. Based on feedback and local knowledge, we received contextual knowledge on salmon populations within the region, described within Biological Data and Analytical methods, and were able to improve upon forestry data with contributions from the Gowgaia Institute (described in Section 5.5.2 Habitat Data and Analytical Methods). Figure 5.41: Map of the Haida Gwaii Region. 5.6.1 Biological Data and Analytical Methods As with the Skeena and Nass regions, in the Haida Gwaii Region many of the datasets necessary to understand the dynamics of salmon CUs have been compiled and stored through the North and Central Coast (NCC) Database (English et al., 2018; see Skeena Region). Details on specific data sources, analytical methods, and nuances specific to the Haida Gwaii Region are described below. 5.6.1.1 Spawner Surveys Spawner survey data for streams in the Haida Gwaii Region were sourced from DFO’s New Salmon Escapement Database (NuSEDS). For a description of the spawner survey indicator, see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, A: Spawner Surveys. 5.6.1.2 Spawner Abundance Observed spawner abundance for CUs on the in the Haida Gwaii Region is the sum of all spawner survey data as documented in NuSEDS, as described in Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, B: Spawner Abundance. Similar to our work in other adjacent regions (Central Coast, Skeena, Nass), we accessed most of these datasets via the North and Central Coast (NCC) database, maintained by LGL Ltd. (English et al., 2018). Haida Gwaii CU-level estimates of spawner abundance (run reconstructions) were sourced from the North and Central Coast (NCC) database. Haida Gwaii CU-level estimated spawner abundance time series were developed for the NCC database according to the expansion factors described in the Skeena Region section above. At time of publication, the data is current to 2017. On Haida Gwaii, the decline in monitoring coverage over the last 10-20 years was mentioned as an area of concern, and a decline in assessments may affect the relationships used to develop total estimates of spawner abundance (run reconstructions), as described in Section 4.1.3 Data Quality. 5.6.1.3 Run Timing We currently do not have CU-level run timing data for any CUs in the Haida Gwaii Region. We will update this information as CU-level run timing data become publicly available. See Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, C: Run Timing for a description of the run timing indicator and methods. 5.6.1.4 Catch &amp; Run Size Catch and run size dand subsequent exploitation rates for CUs on the Haida Gwaii Region were calculated by DFO and LGL from data in the Fisheries Operating System (FOS) and other DFO databases. Similar to our work in other adjacent regions (Central Coast, Skeena, Nass), we accessed most of these datasets via the North and Central Coast (NCC) database, maintained by LGL Ltd. (English et al., 2018). At time of publication, the data is current to 2017. For a description of catch and run size methods, see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, D: Catch &amp; Run Size. On Haida Gwaii, there are some specific nuances to catch data that are important to be aware of when considering the role of catch in estimates of total annual salmon run size. For sockeye salmon, the catch is calculated from a fixed estimate of an annual exploitation rate of 20%. Local knowledge suggests this value may be high, but the representativeness of a fixed rate is less likely to capture annual differences. There is only one Coded Wire Tag indicator stock for coho salmon, so these values are applied to all other coho when used in catch calculations. These considerations in estimates of catch are discussed in Section 4.1.3 Data Quality. 5.6.1.5 Recruits-per-Spawner Recruits-per-spawner data for CUs in the Haida Gwaii Region were derived from the DFO age database and CU-level estimates of spawner abundance and catch and run size accessed from the North and Central Coast (NCC) database (English et al., 2018). For a description of recruits-per-spawner methods, see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, E: Recruits-per-Spawner. 5.6.1.6 Trends in Spawner Abundance Trends in spawner abundance for CUs on Haida Gwaii were derived from the CU-level estimates of spawner abundance accessed from the North and Central Coast (NCC) database (English et al. 2018). For a description of trends in spawner abundance methods, see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, F: Trends in Spawner Abundance. 5.6.1.7 Juvenile Surveys Juvenile abundance data for CUs in the Haida Gwaii were available from Haida Fisheries for a coho juvenile outmigration program at Deena River in the East Haida Gwaii coho CU. We will update this information as other juvenile data becomes available. For a description of the juvenile survey indicator, see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, G: Juvenile Surveys. 5.6.1.8 Hatchery Releases Hatchery releases in the Haida Gwaii Region for all species were provided by DFO (Joan Bateman, Salmonid Enhancement Program). Refer to Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, H: Hatchery Releases for details on data and analytical methods. 5.6.1.9 Biological Status The biological status assessments for CUs in the Haida Gwaii Region currently reflect data sourced from the North and Central Coast (NCC) database that are current to 2017. As new data become available, we will update the analyses and results in this report as well as on the Pacific Salmon Explorer. See Sections 4.1.4. Benchmarks for Assessing Biological Status and 4.1.5. Decision Rules for Assessing Biological Status for more details on biological status assessment methods. Local knowledge suggests that some CU statuses might be biased high compared to current abundance, as the data is only current to 2017. This was particularly discussed for coho – of all spawner surveys on Haida Gwaii, the ratio of indicator: non-indicator streams are the lowest for coho, so expansions to determine CU levels of escapement undergo increased undertenancy. Coho is prevalent in many of Haida Gwaii’s watercourses, so attempting CU level estimates of spawners is inherently challenging. 5.6.2 Habitat Data and Analytical Methods Nuances regarding habitat pressure indicator data and analytical methods for the Haida Gwaii Region are listed below. Refer to Section 4.2 Indicators and Benchmarks for Assessing Habitat Status for information on habitat pressure indicators, benchmarks, and the analytical methods used to assess habitat status. Additional details on habitat pressure indicators, data sources, data currency, and benchmarks specific to the Haida Gwaii Region are available in Appendix 6 (Description of Habitat Pressure Indicators &amp; Relevance to Salmon), Appendix 7 (Habitat Pressure Datasets &amp; Data Sources), Appendix 8 (Spatial Data Processing for Habitat Pressure Indicators), Appendix 9 (Spatial Data Processing for Future Pressures), and Appendix 12 (Habitat Pressure Benchmark Values by Region). 5.6.2.1 Spawning Zones of Influence Methods for delineating Chinook CU spawning zones of influence (ZOIs) vary by region in accordance with the CU delineation approach used by DFO. In the Skeena, Nass, Central Coast, and Haida Gwaii regions, Chinook CUs are defined using a more restrictive geographic representation, which resulted in fewer (or no) spawning locations occurring within the CU boundaries. As such, spawning ZOIs for each Chinook CU were delineated using the extent of all 1:20K FWA Assessment Watersheds that directly intersected with Haida Gwaii Chinook CU boundaries. 5.6.2.2 Marian/Eden Conservation Unit Boundary Based on feedback from the Haida Gwaii Technical Working Group, the name of the Marian Lake sockeye conservation unit was renamed to “Marian/Eden.” The original name developed by DFO (Holtby and Ciruna, 2007) and in DFO’s New Salmon Escapement Database was “Marian” however, TWG members indicated that most of the salmon and surveys are in Eden Lake, and a recent DFO IFMP for Northern Salmon listed “Marian/Eden” rather than “Marian” (DFO, 2019). Additionally, while defined by Holtby and Ciruna (2007) as a conservation unit, DFO did not have a conservation unit boundary defined for this CU. We defined the CU boundary as the same spatial extent as the spawning habitat for Marian Lake (which encompasses the watersheds that contain Marian Lake, Eden Lake, and Roy Lake). 5.6.2.3 Spatial Data Processing for Habitat Pressure Indicators 5.6.2.3.1 Forest Disturbance on Haida Gwaii Working with John Broadhead and Dave Leversee of the Gowgaia Institute, we accessed the best available logging history (harvested areas) dataset compiled for Haida Gwaii. The Gowgaia Institute produced this logging history dataset as part of the Riparian Fish Forest on Haida Gwaii project (Broadhead 2009), and they updated this dataset to 2021. The Gowgaia dataset provided a more complete representation of forest disturbance on Haida Gwaii than was available in the VRI and Consolidated Cutblocks datasets that we used to assess forest disturbance in other regions to date. The spatial data processing method for forest disturbance on Haida Gwaii was updated to source the Gowgaia dataset (Appendix 8). With their expert knowledge of logging history on Haida Gwaii, the Gowgaia Institute also identified areas where assessing risk at the assessment watershed scale may over or underrepresent more localized risk. Categorizing risk at the assessment watershed-scale generalizes risk across watersheds. As such, at this scale, it is not possible to identify whether risk is evenly distributed across a watershed or is more concentrated in certain parts of a watershed. Areas that the Gowgaia Institute identified as suffering from this limitation were Haines Creek and watersheds on NE Graham Island, where much of these areas are unimpacted by harvesting; they were categorized as moderate risk due harvesting that occurred in concentrated areas of these watersheds. 5.6.2.3.1.1 Total Land Cover Alteration on Haida Gwaii The spatial data processing method for total land cover alteration on Haida Gwaii used newly available data sources from the Province of BC’s Cumulative Effects Framework (BC CEF) team as well as the logging history (harvested areas) dataset from Gowgaia Institute. BC CEF’s Human Disturbance with Base Thematic Mapping (2021) dataset was used as the data source for polygons representing the following disturbance types: mountain pine beetle (not present on Haida Gwaii), railway and airports, recreation, transmission lines, major rights of ways, mining, oil &amp; gas infrastructure, seismic infrastructure (not present on Haida Gwaii), agriculture and urban areas. BC CEF’s Integrated Roads (2021) dataset was used as the data source for roads which were then buffered as outlined for processing the road development indicator (Appendix 8). 5.6.2.3.2 Riparian Disturbance on Haida Gwaii The riparian disturbance indicator used the total land cover alteration layer as an input data layer. As such, the spatial data processing methods used newly available data sources from the Province of BC’s Cumulative Effects Framework (BC CEF) team as well as the logging history (harvested areas) dataset from Gowgaia Institute (Appendix 8). 5.6.2.3.3 Road Development on Haida Gwaii The spatial data processing method for road development on Haida Gwaii used the newly available Integrated Roads (2021) dataset from the Province of BC’s Cumulative Effects Framework team (Appendix 8). 5.6.2.3.4 Linear Development on Haida Gwaii The spatial data processing method for linear development on Haida Gwaii used the newly available Integrated Roads (2021) dataset from the Province of BC’s Cumulative Effects Framework team (Appendix 8). 5.6.2.3.5 Equivalent Clearcut Area on Haida Gwaii The spatial data processing method for calculating equivalent clearcut area (ECA) used the total land cover alteration layer as an input data layer. As such, the spatial data processing methods used newly available data sources from the Province of BC’s Cumulative Effects Framework (BC CEF) team as well as the logging history (harvested areas) dataset from Gowgaia Institute (Appendix 8). Specifically, BC CEF’s Human Disturbance with Base Thematic Mapping (2021) dataset was used as the data source for polygons representing the following disturbance types: mountain pine beetle (not present on Haida Gwaii), railway and airports, transmission lines, major rights of ways, mining, oil &amp; gas infrastructure, seismic infrastructure (not present on Haida Gwaii), agriculture and urban areas. BC CEF’s Integrated Roads dataset was used as the data source for roads which were then buffered as outlined for processing the road development indicator (Table A.18; Appendix 8). Fire polygons were sourced from the Current Fire Perimeters and Historical Fire Perimeters datasets available on DataBC. Harvested areas were sourced from the Vegetation Resources Inventory (VRI) database available on DataBC and supplemented with Gowgaia Institute’s logging disturbance dataset for harvested areas not captured in the VRI dataset. ECA disturbance types were identified as “recoverable” and “non-recoverable.” Non-recoverable disturbance types are those where the land disturbance is considered permanent and recorded as 100% ECA. Non-recoverable disturbance types include railway and airports, transmission lines, major rights of ways, mining, oil &amp; gas infrastructure, seismic infrastructure (not present on Haida Gwaii), agriculture, and urban areas. Recoverable disturbance types, where the hydrologic function of the landscape is expected to recover over time (i.e. second-growth forest), include harvested areas, burned areas, and areas impacted by mountain pine beetle (not present on Haida Gwaii). ECA recovery curves identify a recovery factor based on stand height. Projected stand height is sourced from the VRI dataset. ECA recovery curves were updated in 2019 to differentiate recovery rates for interior and coastal forests (FREP 2019). A “non-recoverable” layer was created by first merging and dissolving all non-recoverable disturbance types. Harvested and burned area polygons were dissolved based on projected stand height and then merged with the non-recoverable layer. Lastly, harvested area and burned area polygons without stand height but with a date of disturbance were dissolved based on time since disturbance (years) and merged with the non-recoverable and recoverable polygons with stand height. This combined ECA layer was overlaid with the FWA assessment watersheds. The growth recovery of each polygon was calculated based on stand height using the coastal recovery curve or using a time since disturbance surrogate method where stand height information was not readily available. The growth recovery of each recoverable polygon with stand height information was calculated using the following equation: \\[ ECA = A*C*(1-R/100) \\] where \\(A\\) is the original polygon area, \\(C\\) is the proportion of the opening covered by functional regeneration (determined from Table A2.1, MOF, 2001), and \\(R\\) is the recovery factor (for coastal forests from Hudson, R., and G. Horel, 2007 and from Winkler, R., and S. Boon, 2015 for interior forests). For non-recoverable polygons, there is no functional regeneration or recovery factor, so for these polygons, \\(C\\) will be equal to 1, and \\(R\\) will be equal to 0. Where stand height is not available (e.g. for harvested areas sourced from the Gowgaia Institute) a time since disturbance surrogate was used to estimate ECA: 1-10 yrs = 100% ECA, 11-20 = 75%, 21-40 = 25% and 40-50 yrs = 5%, &gt;50 years = 0%1 . ECA was summed for each FWA watershed then divided by the total watershed area to give an ECA percentage for each watershed. 5.6.2.4 Spawning Habitat Information from Expert Knowledge Holders In addition to the spawning habitat information we acquired from DataBC (primarily from the Fisheries Information Summary System (FISS) database), we collaborated with representatives from Haida Fisheries, Fisheries and Oceans Canada’s Salmon Enhancement Program, Parks Canada, the Gowgaia Institute, the Hecate Strait Streamkeepers, and independent salmon experts to identify local salmon spawning locations. The collective identified 16 new salmon-bearing watersheds that had not been previously documented, further enhancing the baseline of available information for Haida Gwaii salmon. 5.6.3 Results 5.6.3.1 Biological Status This section provides a high-level overview of the biological status results for the 29 salmon CUs in the Haida Gwaii Region. Of the 29 CUs we examined in the Region, we were able to assess biological status for 16 CUs (55%). The remaining 13 salmon CUs (45%) had insufficient information for evaluating their biological status (see Section 4.1.5 Decision Rules for Assessing Biological Status for the criteria used to define data deficient CUs). Of the CUs for which we were able to assess biological status, 9 (56%) of CUs are in the green status zone, 4 (25%) are in the amber zone, and 3 (19%) are in the red status zone. Biological status for each CU is displayed by species in Figures 5.42, 5.43, ??, 5.45, 5.46, 5.47, 5.48, and ??, below. More information on biological status and benchmarks for each CU is available in Table A.12 in Appendix 4. Full results are available online through the Pacific Salmon Explorer, where individual figures, maps, data, and summary statistics are provided for each CU in the Region. The results of these assessments reflect data that are current to 2017. As new data become available, we will update the analyses and results in this report and on the Pacific Salmon Explorer.

Figure 5.48: Pacific Salmon Foundation biological status of Haida Gwaii sockeye (river-type) salmon Conservation Units. 5.6.3.2 Habitat Status We completed habitat assessments for watersheds within the 29 salmon CUs in the Haida Gwaii Region. The habitat assessments produce two levels of outputs: (1) a risk rating for each Freshwater Atlas (FWA) assessment watershed in the Region for each individual habitat pressure indicator; (2) a cumulative pressure score for each FWA assessment watershed in the Region, representing the risk to a watershed from all habitat pressures combined. Of the 218 1:20K FWA assessment watersheds assessed in the Haida Gwaii Region, 67% (n= 145) were designated as spawning habitat based on compiled spawning location data. These 145 watersheds represent the combined spawning ZOI for all species. In terms of the cumulative pressure scores for the spawning habitat defined by these 145 watersheds, 32% of the spawning habitat is high risk (red), 27% is moderate risk (amber), and 41% is low risk (green). The percentage of spawning habitat area in each risk category for each indicator is summarized in (Table 5.6) below. Quantifying both individual and cumulative pressures at the FWA assessment watershed-scale provides a snapshot of habitat pressures across Haida Gwaii and highlights which CUs face the greatest risk. Specifically, an overview of habitat pressures emerges from identifying: the percent area of watersheds within the combined spawning ZOI for all species that are rated high, moderate, or low risk (i.e. red, amber, green) for each of the evaluated individual habitat pressure indicators; and the percent area of watersheds within the combined spawning ZOI for all species that are rated high, moderate, or low risk (i.e. red, amber, green) for cumulative habitat pressures; More information on habitat pressure benchmark values for each indicator is available in Appendix 12. More information on cumulative spawning Pressure Results by Region and Conservation Unit is available in Appendix 13. Full results are available online through the Pacific Salmon Explorer. For each CU, the results can be accessed from the Pacific Salmon Explorer, and the datasets compiled for the analysis are available for download via the Salmon Data Library. % Area of Spawning Habitat Table 5.6: The percentage of area within the Haida Gwaii Region’s combined spawning ZOI for all species rated high, moderate, or low risk (i.e. red, amber, green) for cumulative pressures and each of the evaluated individual habitat pressure indicators.

We have not assessed the biological status or threats to salmon habitats within those areas outside of Canada (Figure 5.49), having defined the Columbia region as the entirety of the watershed in Canada. There are two salmon CUs within the Canadian ‘Columbia Region’ on the Pacific Salmon Explorer - one Chinook and one lake-type sockeye. The process of data gathering and synthesis to complete the initial assessments within the Columbia Region took place over a number of years and was completed in 2022. Figure 5.49: Map of the Columbia Region. The Columbia River has an extensive history of development, including dams – salmon have been extirpated from most of the upper Columbia drainage in Canada for more than 80 years. The Okanagan River sub-basin contains the only remaining salmon populations. While two CUs are currently defined, local and traditional knowledge and downstream observations suggest a spring Chinook run (distinct from the current Chinook CU) and coho also occur in the region. Steelhead passage also occurs through the Zosel dam, just south end of Osoyoos lake, a cross border lake. 5.7.1 Biological Data and Analytical Methods In the Columbia Region, we accessed datasets for biological indicators from published reports (COSEWIC, 2017; Hyatt &amp; Stockwell, 2019; Matylewich et al., 2019) and DFO (Ogden, pers comm). Additional data was sourced from NuSEDS if applicable. Details on specific data sources and analytical methods for the Columbia Region are described below. 5.7.1.1 Spawner Surveys Spawner survey data for streams in the Columbia Region were sourced from DFO’s (New Salmon Escapement Database (NuSEDS) and Ogden, pers comm), COSEWIC (2017), Matylewich et al. (2019), and Hyatt and Stockwell (2019). For a description of the spawner survey indicator, For a description of the spawner survey indicator, see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, A: Spawner Surveys. 5.7.1.2 Spawner Abundance Observed spawner abundance for CUs in the Columbia Region, represent the total number of mature salmon that return to a CU to spawn in a given year. Stockwell and Hyatt (2003) describe survey methods and analytical techniques of summary estimates of annual escapement. Considerations in spawner abundance are also described in Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, B: Spawner Abundance. Columbia CU-level estimates of spawner abundance (run reconstructions) were sourced from COSEWIC (2017), Matylewich et al. (2019), Hyatt &amp; Stockwell (2019) and DFO (Ogden, pers comm). 5.7.1.3 Run Timing Estimates of the average timing at which Okanagan watershed salmon return to spawn were based on run timing at Zosel Dam (Columbia River DART, 2022). The duration of the timing of river entry has an assumed bell-shaped curve (i.e. normal distribution). The shape of the curve is defined by the mean and standard deviation of the available run timing data. For Osoyoos sockeye and Okanagan Chinook, the run timing values are comprised of averaged values from 2006-2017. Note that salmon migrating up the Columbia and Okanagan are known to be heavily affected by water temperatures in any given year (Hyatt et al., 2003). See Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, C: Run Timing for a description of the run timing indicator and methods. 5.7.1.4 Catch &amp; Run Size Catch and run size and subsequent exploitation rates for CUs on the Columbia were sourced from Hyatt and Stockwell (2019) for sockeye and were not available for Chinook. For a description of catch and run size methods see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, D: Catch &amp; Run Size. 5.7.1.5 Recruits-per-Spawner Recruits-per-spawner data for CUs in the Columbia Region were not available. For a description of recruits-per-spawner methods, see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, E: Recruits-per-Spawner. 5.7.1.6 Trends in Spawner Abundance Trends in spawner abundance for CUs in the Columbia Region were derived from Spawner Abundance Estimates. For a description of trends in spawner abundance methods, see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, F: Trends in Spawner Abundance. 5.7.1.7 Juvenile Surveys Juvenile survey data for CUs in the Columbia were not available. For a description of the juvenile surveys indicator, see Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, G: Juvenile Surveys. 5.7.1.8 Hatchery Releases Hatchery releases in the Columbia Region for all species were provided by DFO (Joan Bateman, Salmonid Enhancement Program). Refer to Section 4.1.1. Overview of Biological Indicators, H: Hatchery Releases for details on data and analytical methods. 5.7.1.9 Biological Status The biological status assessments for CUs in the Columbia Region currently reflect sockeye data sourced from the Hyatt and Stockwell (2019) and DFO current to 2020. There was insufficient data for Chinook status assessment at this time, but an expert COSEWIC review (2017) determined an “Endangered” status with data to 2015. As new data become available, we will update the analyses and results in this report as well as on the Pacific Salmon Explorer. See Sections 4.1.4. Benchmarks for Assessing Biological Status and 4.1.5. Decision Rules for Assessing Biological Status for more details on biological status assessment methods. 5.7.2 Habitat Data and Analytical Methods Nuances regarding habitat pressure indicator data and analytical methods for the Columbia Region are listed below. Refer to Section 4.2 Indicators and Benchmarks for Assessing Habitat Status for information on habitat pressure indicators, benchmarks, and the analytical methods used to assess habitat status. Additional details on habitat pressure indicators, data sources, data currency, and benchmarks specific to the Columbia Region are available in Appendix 6 (Description of Habitat Pressure Indicators &amp; Relevance to Salmon), Appendix 7 (Habitat Pressure Datasets &amp; Data Sources), Appendix 8 (Spatial Data Processing for Habitat Pressure Indicators), Appendix 9 (Spatial Data Processing for Future Pressures), and Appendix 12 (Habitat Pressure Benchmark Values by Region). 5.7.2.1 Spawning Zones of Influence Methods for delineating Chinook CU spawning zones of influence (ZOIs) vary by region in accordance with the CU delineation approach used by DFO. In the Fraser, Vancouver Island and Mainland Inlets, and Columbia regions, Chinook CUs are more broadly defined geographically, which means that the methods employed for determining pink, chum, and coho spawning ZOIs were also applicable to Chinook CUs. The localized spawning ZOI for each Columbia Chinook CU was delineated by capturing the extent of all 1:20K FWA assessment watersheds that directly intersect with known spawning locations for Chinook. 5.7.2.2 Spatial Data Processing for Habitat Pressure Indicators 5.7.2.2.1 Total Land Cover Alteration on Columbia The spatial data processing method for total land cover alteration in the Columbia region used newly available data sources from the Province of BC’s Cumulative Effects Framework (BC CEF) team. BC CEF’s Human Disturbance with Base Thematic Mapping (2021) dataset was used as the data source for polygons representing the following disturbance types: mountain pine beetle, railway and airports, recreation, transmission lines, major rights of ways, mining, oil &amp; gas infrastructure, seismic infrastructure, agriculture, and urban areas. BC CEF’s Integrated Roads (2021) dataset was used as the data source for roads which were then buffered as outlined for processing the road development indicator Appendix 8. 5.7.2.2.2 Riparian Disturbance on Columbia The riparian disturbance indicator used the total land cover alteration layer as an input data layer. As such, the spatial data processing methods used newly available data sources from the Province of BC’s Cumulative Effects Framework (BC CEF) team Appendix 8. 5.7.2.2.3 Linear Development in the Columbia Region The spatial data processing method for linear development in the Columbia region used the newly available Integrated Roads (2021) dataset from the Province of BC’s Cumulative Effects Framework team Appendix 8. 5.7.2.2.4 Equivalent Clearcut Area in the Columbia Region The spatial data processing method for calculating equivalent clearcut area (ECA) used the total land cover alteration layer as an input data layer. As such, the spatial data processing methods used newly available data sources from the Province of BC’s Cumulative Effects Framework (BC CEF) team (Appendix 8). Specifically, BC CEF’s Human Disturbance with Base Thematic Mapping (2021) dataset was used as the data source for polygons representing the following disturbance types: mountain pine beetle, railway and airports, transmission lines, major rights of ways, mining, oil &amp; gas infrastructure, seismic infrastructure, agriculture, and urban areas. BC CEF’s Integrated Roads dataset was used as the data source for roads which were then buffered as outlined for processing the road development indicator (Table A.18; Appendix 8). Fire polygons were sourced from the Current Fire Perimeters and Historical Fire Perimeters datasets available on DataBC. Harvested areas were sourced from the Vegetation Resources Inventory (VRI) database available on DataBC. ECA disturbance types were identified as “recoverable” and “non-recoverable.” Non-recoverable disturbance types are those where the land disturbance is considered permanent and recorded as 100% ECA. Non-recoverable disturbance types include railway and airports, transmission lines, major rights of way, mining, oil &amp; gas infrastructure, seismic infrastructure, agriculture, and urban areas. Recoverable disturbance types, where the hydrologic function of the landscape is expected to recover over time (i.e. second-growth forest), include harvested areas, burned areas, and areas impacted by mountain pine. ECA recovery curves identify a recovery factor based on stand height. Projected stand height is sourced from the VRI dataset. ECA recovery curves were updated in 2019 to differentiate recovery rates for interior and coastal forests (FREP 2019). A “non-recoverable” layer was created by first merging and dissolving all non-recoverable disturbance types. Harvested and burned area polygons were dissolved based on projected stand height and then merged with the non-recoverable layer. Lastly, harvested area and burned area polygons without stand height but with a date of disturbance were dissolved based on time since disturbance (years) and merged with the non-recoverable and recoverable polygons with stand height. This combined ECA layer was overlaid with the FWA assessment watersheds. The growth recovery of each polygon was calculated based on stand height using the interior recovery curve or using a time since disturbance surrogate method where stand height information was not readily available. The growth recovery of each recoverable polygon with stand height information was calculated using the following equation: ECA = A*C(1-R/100) where A is the original polygon area, C is the proportion of the opening covered by functional regeneration (determined from Table A2.1, MOF 2001), and R is the recovery factor (for coastal forests from Hudson and Horel (2007) and from Winkler and Boon (2015) for interior forests). For non-recoverable polygons, there is no functional regeneration or recovery factor, so for these polygons, C will be equal to 1, and R will be equal to 0. Where stand height is not available (e.g. for harvested areas sourced from the Gowgaia Institute), a time since disturbance surrogate was used to estimate ECA: 1-10 yrs. = 100% ECA, 11-20 = 75%, 21-40 = 25% and 40-50 yrs. = 5%, &gt;50 years = 0%[\\(^2\\)]. ECA was summed for each FWA watershed and then divided by the total watershed area to give an ECA percentage for each watershed. 5.7.2.3 Spawning Habitat Information Spawning areas identified in the Known BC Fish Observations and Distributions were minimal. We supplemented this data with local knowledge and information in published literature, including sockeye (Stockwell and Hyatt (2003), Hyatt and Stockwell (2019), Stockwell et al. (2020), and Chinook (Matylewich et al. (2019), Mahony et al. (2021)). 5.7.3 Results 5.7.3.1 Biological Status This section provides a high-level overview of the biological status results for the two salmon CUs in the Columbia Region. Of the two CUs we examined in the Region, we were able to assess biological status for one CU (50%). The remaining salmon CUs had insufficient information for evaluating their biological status (see Section 4.1.5 Decision Rules for Assessing Biological Status for the criteria used to define data deficient CUs). For the Osoyoos sockeye CU, we were able to assess status using the spawner abundance percentile benchmark method, which was in the green status zone. Biological status for each CU is displayed by species in Figures 5.50, ??, ??, ??, ??, 5.51, ??, and ??, below. More information on biological status and benchmarks for each CU is available in Table A.12 in Appendix 4. Full results are available online through the Pacific Salmon Explorer, where individual figures, maps, data, and summary statistics are provided for each CU in the Region. The results of these assessments reflect data that are current to 2020 for sockeye and 2015 for Chinook. As new data becomes available, we will update the analyses and results in this report and the Pacific Salmon Explorer. Figure 5.50: Pacific Salmon Foundation biological status of Columbia Chinook salmon Conservation Units. Figure 5.51: Pacific Salmon Foundation biological status of Columbia sockeye (lake-type) salmon Conservation Units. 5.7.3.2 Habitat Status We completed habitat assessments for watersheds within the two salmon CUs in the Columbia Inlets Region. The habitat assessments produce two levels of outputs for spawning ZOIs: (1) a risk rating for each FWA assessment watershed in the study area for each individual habitat pressure indicator; (2) a cumulative pressure score for each FWA assessment watershed in the study area, representing the risk to a watershed from all habitat pressures combined. Of the 2130 1:20K FWA assessment watersheds assessed in the Columbia Region, 7% (n= 148) were designated as spawning habitat based on compiled spawning location data. These 148 watersheds represent the combined spawning ZOI for all species. In terms of the cumulative pressure scores for the 148 spawning watersheds, 0% are low risk (red), 5% are moderate risk (amber), and 95% are high risk. The percent of spawning watersheds in each risk category for each indicator is summarized in (Table 5.7) below. Quantifying both individual and cumulative pressures at the FWA assessment watershed-scale provides a snapshot of habitat pressures across the entire Columbia region and highlights which CUs face the greatest risk. Specifically, an overview of habitat pressures emerges from identifying: the percentage of watersheds within the combined spawning ZOI for all species that are rated high, moderate, or low risk (i.e. red, amber, green) for each of the evaluated individual habitat pressure indicators; and the percentage of watersheds within the combined spawning ZOI for all species that are rated high, moderate, or low risk (i.e. red, amber, green) for cumulative habitat pressures; More information on habitat pressure benchmark values for each indicator is available in Appendix 12. More information on cumulative spawning Pressure Results by Region and Conservation Unit is available in Appendix 13. Full results are available online through the Pacific Salmon Explorer. For each CU, the results can be downloaded directly from the Pacific Salmon Explorer. The datasets compiled for the analysis are also available for download via the Salmon Data Library. % Area of Spawning Habitat Table 5.7: The percentage of area within the Columbia Region’s combined spawning ZOI for all species rated high, moderate, or low risk (i.e. red, amber, green) for cumulative pressures and each of the evaluated individual habitat pressure indicators.

BC Cumulative Effects Framework (BC CEF) ECA method includes an additional step to approximate stand height where not available in VRI before defaulting to this time since disturbance surrogate ECA estimate. This data was not available to us at the time of our assessments but our upcoming work to revise our habitat indicator methods will aim to source ECA directly from BC CEF or to update our methods to fill stand height data gaps where possible.↩︎ "],["conclusions.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusions and Future Directions", " Chapter 6 Conclusions and Future Directions By synthesizing and providing open access to information and standardized assessments of salmon biological status and pressures on freshwater habitats, the Pacific Salmon Explorer can help inform and improve decision-making for the conservation and management of wild salmon. This information can help identify where to apply management interventions to support the recovery of at-risk populations and where more research and monitoring efforts are needed to assess threats to salmon habitat properly. Determining which CUs are high priorities for management interventions and recovery planning is challenging. It requires both assumptions and acceptance of the inherent uncertainty in assessing biological status and habitat pressures. Acknowledging these challenges, we suggest prioritizing efforts under two scenarios. (1) CUs whose biological status is in the red status zone based on both PSF assessments and other integrated status assessments, and (2) CUs where biological status is data deficient and habitat risk level is red. However, given the numerous trade-offs and other factors to consider in conservation planning, we recommend that the Pacific Salmon Explorer outputs be considered part of a broader strategic planning approach. One that considers societal values, recovery potential, and the feasibility and cost of management and conservation actions. Compiling and synthesizing information all available data sources related to salmon and Salmon CUs serves to improve our understanding of wild salmon population status and the apparent reasons for a given status. Additional pressures affecting salmon that are not currently included on the Pacific Salmon Explorer should also be considered. For example, climate change-related indicators and indicators of marine productivity have important implications for the productivity and abundance of wild Pacific salmon. Given the iterative nature of our work, the current set of biological and habitat indicators are likely to evolve, and this technical report and its methodologies will be updated accordingly. PSF intends to continue working in collaboration with Fisheries and Oceans Canada, First Nations, and other salmon experts to regularly update the biological and habitat indicators used for assessments to ensure that the Pacific Salmon Explorer remains a comprehensive and trusted resource for informing decision making associated with salmon conservation, management, and recovery.

"],["appendix-5.html", "Appendix 5: Rules for Defining Zones of Influence", " Appendix 5: Rules for Defining Zones of Influence We define ZOIs for the spawning life stage for each salmon CU. A spawning ZOI represents the area of land that drains directly into the spawning habitat of a specific salmon CU. To spatially define ZOIs, we use the Province of British Columbia’s 1:20,000 Freshwater Atlas (FWA) Assessment Watersheds dataset (hereafter, 1:20K FWA assessment watersheds), which is a geospatial dataset freely available online via DataBC. The rules for defining ZOIs were initially developed by the Skeena Technical Advisory Committee (Porter et al. 2013, 2014) with specific nuances that vary by species and life stage. Spatial processing for all ZOIs has been conducted using ArcGIS Desktop 10.6 using Python scripts, which allow automatic querying of the FWA hierarchical coding systems to identify areas upslope of a given spawning area. For lake-type sockeye CU, this process identifies all of those streams that are directly upslope of spawning lakes and captures them. ZOIs for all species across all regions are manually reviewed, verified, and corrected as needed. Lake-type Sockeye CU Zones of Influence Spawning ZOI: For each CU, we identify the lake outlet and define an upstream ZOI by delineating the areas of all 1:20K FWA assessment watersheds that are upstream of the lake outlet. This upstream area captures the area of land which influences spawning sites for lake-type sockeye CUs. River-type Sockeye CU Zones of Influence Spawning ZOI: The extent of all 1:20K FWA assessment watersheds that directly intersect with known spawning locations for river-type sockeye. Chum CU Zones of Influence Spawning ZOI: The FWA assessment watersheds that intersect directly with known chum spawning locations delineate the spawning ZOI for each chum CU. Chinook CU Zones of Influence Methods for delineating Chinook CU spawning zones of influence vary by region in accordance with the CU delineation approach used by DFO. In the Skeena, Nass, Central Coast, and Haida Gwaii Regions, Chinook CUs are defined using a more restrictive geographic representation. In the Fraser, Vancouver Island and Mainland Inlets, and Columbia regions, Chinook CUs are more broadly defined geographically. Spawning ZOI (Skeena, Nass, Central Coast, and Haida Gwaii Regions ): All the FWA assessment watersheds that intersect directly with Chinook CU locations, regardless of whether or not spawning locations were identified for Chinook within an assessment watershed. Spawning ZOI (Fraser, VIMI, and Columbia Regions): Defined by the full extent of the 1:20K FWA assessment watersheds that directly intersect with identified spawning locations for each Chinook CU. In the Columbia region, assessment watersheds that contained spawning locations upstream of the CU boundary were included as part of the CU’s spawning ZOI. Coho CU Zones of Influence Spawning ZOI: Defined by the full extent of the 1:20K FWA assessment watersheds that directly intersect with identified spawning locations for each coho CU. Pink CU Zones of Influence Spawning ZOI: Defined by the full extent of the 1:20K FWA assessment watersheds that directly intersect with identified spawning locations for each pink salmon CU.

Indicator Metric Description Rationale Limitations Total Land Cover Alteration % watershed area The percentage of the total watershed area that has been altered by human activity. A sum of forest disturbance, urban land use, agricultural/rural land use, mining development, and other development.  Represents potential changes in cumulative watershed processes, such as hydrologic flows and sediment generation, that can affect spawning and rearing habitats downstream (Poff et al. 2006, in Stalberg et al. 2009). The data currency and completeness varies for the data sources included in this indicator. Specifically, the land cover classification dataset is current only to 2005 (1996-2005).  Mining Development # of mines The number of active and past-producing coal, mineral, or aggregate (gravel) mine sites within a watershed. Mining development can affect or potentially cause the loss of salmon habitat, through the actual footprint of the mine itself, any tailings ponds, other infrastructure development, or indirectly through the disruption of stream beds and input of fine sediment or other contaminants (Meehan 1991, Nelson et al. 1991, Kondolf 1997).  The aggregate mining dataset was last updated in 2004. Data on the actual footprints of mine sites and other infrastructure development is not readily available at the watershed scale. Impacts of mines are therefore assessed in a binary (presence/absence) manner. Impervious Surfaces % watershed area The percentage of the total watershed area that is represented by hard, impervious surfaces (e.g. paved). This indicator reflects the number of built structures (e.g. paved roads, sidewalks, buildings, etc.) that are covered by impervious surfaces (e.g. concrete, asphalt, brick, etc.). Extensive impervious surfaces in a watershed can alter and affect natural hydrologic flow patterns and lead to stream degradation through changes in geomorphology and hydrology, and can also lead to increased nutrient loading and contaminant loads downstream (Rosenau and Angelo 2009). The concentration of impervious surfaces in the built environment and the relative irreversibility of this disturbance means that the impact on habitat quality is typically very high (Schendel et al. 2004; Schindler et al. 2006; Smith et al. 2007; Jokinen et al. 2010; Paul and Meyer 2001 in Nelitz et al. 2011; Cooke et al. 2020.   Patterns of urban/rural development may be overestimated in some Regions (e.g. Central Coast) as the Impervious Surface Coefficients (ISCs) for land types used in this analysis were developed for watersheds in Connecticut (Prisloe et al. 2003) with higher population densities (&gt;500 but &lt;1800 people/square mile).  Linear Development km/km2 The density of all linear developments within a watershed, including roads, railways, utility corridors, pipelines, power lines, telecom cables, right of ways, etc. Linear development gives an indication of the overall level of development from resource activities that may affect salmon habitats (WCEL 2011, FLNRORD et al. 2012).  See Road Development Forest Disturbance % watershed area The percentage of total watershed area that has been disturbed by logging and burning in the last 60 years.  Logging and other disturbances that reduce forest cover can change watershed hydrology by affecting rainfall interception, transpiration, and snowmelt processes, which may affect salmon habitats through altered peak flows, low flows, and annual water yields (MOF 1995, Smith and Redding 2012).  Datasets may be limited by private land ownership in some Regions, which may result in an underestimate of Forest Disturbance. The temporal cutoff of 60 years may be inappropriate in some cases (e.g. highly developed urban areas, or watersheds with slower regeneration patterns such as snow-dominated biogeoclimatic zones).  Equivalent Clearcut Area (ECA) % watershed area The percentage of total watershed area that is considered comparable to a clearcut forest. ECA represents the cumulative effect of harvesting and second-growth forests on the hydrological cycle.  A derived metric of forest disturbance, ECA reflects the pressure on salmon habitat mainly from potential increases in peak flow (MOF 2001; Smith and Redding 2012).  Calculating ECA relies on projected tree height data that is not always available in the data sources; if not available, we assume tree height to be zero. Total Land Cover Alteration limitations also apply here due to overlapping data inputs.  Riparian Disturbance % riparian buffer area The percentage of riparian zone (a 30m buffer zone around all streams, rivers, lakes, and wetlands within a watershed) that has been altered by human activity (forest disturbance, urban land use, agricultural/rural land use, mining development, and other development).  Disturbance to riparian areas can affect salmon habitats by destabilizing stream banks, increasing surface erosion and sedimentation, reducing nutrient and woody debris inputs to water bodies, and increasing stream temperatures if streamside shading is reduced (Meehan 1991, MOF 1995). These impacts have the potential to affect the growth and survival of salmon eggs and juvenile salmon.  The data currency and completeness vary for the data sources included in this indicator. Specifically, the land cover classification dataset is current only to 2005 (1996-2005).  Insect and Disease Defoliation % forest stand killed The percentage of pine forests that have been killed by insects or disease in each watershed. Forest defoliation from insects or diseases can reduce precipitation interception, reduce transpiration, and lead to increased soil moisture. The resulting changes to peak flows and groundwater supplies can affect salmon habitats (Bustanul. 2006, EDI 2008 in Nelitz et al. 2011). The hydrological processes in forest stands affected by insects and disease can take 20-60 years to recover (FPB 2007). If salvage logged, these stands will have the same watershed effects as clear cut logging.  The Vegetation Resources Inventory Dead Layer is primarily based on modelled data. In some cases, modelled data is superceded by photo interpretation but overall reliability of dead stand area should be considered low. Road Development km/km2 The average density of all roads within a watershed. Road development can interrupt sub-surface flow, increase peak flows, and interfere with natural patterns of overland water flow in a watershed (Smith and Redding 2012). Road construction can cause significant erosion by exposing large areas of soil to rain and snow, and roads intercept and amplify surface runoff, leading to increased erosion downslope (MOF 1995). These eroded fine sediments can flush into water bodies, affecting salmon spawning habitats by covering redds, reducing oxygenation of incubating eggs, and increasing turbidity which can lead to reduced foraging success of juveniles (Meehan 1991).  Data is an amalgamation of the Digital Roads Atlas (DRA) and Forest Tenure Road segments that occur outside a 30m buffer of all DRA roads.  Stream Crossing Density #/km The total number of stream crossings per km of the total length of modelled salmon habitat in a watershed. Salmon habitat is defined based on a gradient criterion filtering of the Fish Passage Model (Mount et al. 2011).  Stream crossings can create problems for fish passage by interfering with or blocking access to upstream spawning or rearing habitats, thus decreasing the total amount of available salmon habitat (Harper and Quigley 2000, FLNRO et al. 2012. Stream crossings can also affect water delivery to the stream network, causing increased peak flows, and become a source of fine sediment delivery to streams (MOF 1995; Smith &amp; Redding 2012).  This indicator is based on modelled data determining salmon habitat that is gradient-based, along with the presence of stream crossings which are modelled at the intersection of roads and streams. Stream crossings have not been confirmed nor assessed for actual fish passage.  Water Licenses # of permitted water licenses The total number of water licences permitted for water withdrawal for domestic, industrial, agricultural, power, and storage uses from points of diversion within a watershed. This indicator is evaluated within watersheds for all salmon CUs. For lake-type sockeye CUs, the number of water licenses is also summed across the full extent of all watersheds in each CU migration ZOI to capture the potential combined effect of water extraction on mainstem water levels along the migration routes of lake-type sockeye.  Heavy allocation and use of both surface and subsurface water for human use can affect salmon habitat by reducing instream flow to levels that could, at critical times of the year, limit physical access to spawning and rearing habitats, or potentially expose redds. Reductions in both surface and subsurface water supply can also lead to increased water temperatures, which can impact salmon at all life stages (Richter et al. 2003 and Hatfield et al. 2003 in Stalberg et al. 2009; Douglas 2006).  Water license data represents water allocation only, not actual water use, as monitoring and compliance of water licences do not occur consistently. Water license data also does not account for temporary water permits obtained for short term use.  Waste Water Discharges # of permitted waste water discharges The number of permitted waste water management discharge sites within a watershed.  Waste water discharge can impact water quality in salmon habitats through either chemical contamination, which can directly injure or kill aquatic life (US EPA 2008), or excessive nutrient enrichment (eutrophication), which can result in dissolved oxygen depletion in water bodies and suffocate aquatic organisms (Zheng and Paul 2007).   This dataset only identifies permitted waste water discharge sites. Calculating the actual risk and impact to salmon habitats requires data on the volume and nature of waste water discharge.   "],["appendix-7.html", "Appendix 7: Habitat Pressure Datasets &amp; Data Sources", " Appendix 7: Habitat Pressure Datasets &amp; Data Sources Habitat pressure datasets, data sources, and dataset publication years.
