   abstract = {Overview This memo provides estimates of Skeena sockeye sub-stock timing and abundance entering Area ¾ estimated using genetic (mDNA) samples collected from the Skeena River Tyee Test Fishery from 2000-2010. The genetic samples represent proportionate daily catch sampling conducted at Tyee from mid-June through early September each year. Logistic and cost constraints precluded analyzing all collected samples, and so ~25% to 35% (n = 500 to 1000) of each annual collection was sub-sampled based on weekly test fishery sockeye CPUE (Week 71 = July 1-7, Week 72 = July 8-15 etc). Stock composition analysis of the weekly samples was conducted by DFO's Molecular Genetics Lab in Nanaimo. The stock composition results were expanded to abundance (by stock) using post-season estimates of weekly aggregate-stock sockeye escapement past the Tyee Test fishery from 2000-2010. Expressed proportionally, these data provide "timing" by stock entering (escaping) into the Skeena River each year. However, escapement timing at Tyee does not represent annual run-timing into Area ¾ because of catch removals in the marine fishery. To correct for this bias, reconstructed weekly sockeye harvest rates for the Area ¾ marine fishery from 2000-2010 (Cox-Rogers and Splisted 2010, with updates) were applied to backward-lagged test fishery escapements (by stock) to estimate incoming Area ¾ abundance. The results were then smoothed and plotted for timing interpretation. Results • The "Data" tab on the Excel spreadsheet "TyeeSxtimingDNA2000-2010Feb12.xls" provides the weekly and annual Tyee Test fishery mDNA stock composition results from 2000-2010. Subsequent expansion to reconstructed Area ¾ abundance/timing by sub-stock for each year is also on this tab. • The "Graphs" tab on the Excel spreadsheet "TyeeSxtimingDNA2000-2010Feb12.xls" summarizes just the 2000-2010 Area ¾ smoothed entry timing proportions by stock},

   abstract = {Information on biological status is essential for designing, implementing, and evaluating management strategies and recovery plans for threatened or exploited species. However, the data required to quantify status are often limited, and it is important to understand how assessments of status may be biased by assumptions in data analysis. For Pacific salmon, biological status assessments based on spawner abundances and spawner–recruitment (SR) analyses often involve “run reconstructions” that impute missing spawner data, expand observed spawner abundance to account for unmonitored streams, assign catch to individual stocks, and quantify age-at-return. Using a stochastic simulation approach, we quantified how common assumptions in run reconstructions biased assessments of biological status based on spawner abundance. We found that status assessments were robust to most common assumptions in run reconstructions, even in the face of declining monitoring coverage, but that overestimating catch tended to increase rates of status misclassification. Our results lend confidence to biological status assessments based on spawner abundances and SR analyses, even in the face of incomplete data.},

   abstract = {Status assessments for Chum Salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) under the Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) have been limited, in part because recruitment time-series required to calculate stock- recruitment based benchmarks are not consistently available. Alternative benchmarks have been proposed for data-limited Conservation Units (CUs) using percentiles of the observed spawner abundance time-series. However, these benchmarks have not been evaluated against stock-recruitment benchmarks currently used to assess status on abundances for data-rich CUs. Our goals were to evaluate percentile-based benchmarks against stock-recruitment based benchmarks accounting for high uncertainties and possible biases in spawner abundances, catches, recruitment estimates, and age-at-maturity. We used two approaches to evaluate benchmarks based on a retrospective comparison through the historical record and a prospective simulation model under numerous hypothetical future scenarios. We demonstrate an approach for providing assessments that accounts for uncertainties in benchmarks, and provide advice on the applicability of percentile-based benchmarks for data-limited CUs of Chum Salmon relative to stock-recruitment benchmarks used for data-rich CUs. In general, our results support the application of percentile-based benchmarks for data-limited CUs of Chum Salmon when productivity is moderate to high (>2.5 recruits/spawner) and harvest rates are low to moderate (≤40%). However, we suggest further evaluation of percentile benchmarks (and the consideration of alternatives) when productivity is expected to be low and/or harvest rates high. Under these conditions, concurrent declines in abundances and percentile benchmarks can results in status assessments that are more optimistic than those from stock-recruitment benchmarks due to shifting baselines.},
